1670,1670.svg,"Our understanding of the site in the last quarter of the 17th century is variable – many parts, especially of the Bishops rooms were only partially investigated. The plan shows the site c. 1670, just before Bishop Brynjúlfur Sveinsson left and Þorður Þorðarsson took over. It is a site of three separate blocks: a north-western complex comprising the Bishop’s residence; a north-eastern block which is the school and a southern section which included service rooms and the school dining room. At this time, there was no direct access between the school and the Bishop’s residence – any communication involved walking outside and around; the same seems to apply to the service wing although the absence of a connecting corridor here is more speculative, albeit supported by both archaeological and documentary evidence. The only unusual element is the corridor of the north-eastern block or school. Both the Bishop’s block and service block have central axial corridors with rooms or buildings coming off each side; the corridor on the school lies at the western edge and looks distinctly odd, although there is a small corridor bisecting the schoolmasters rooms from the school, which fed into the underground passage to the Church. The side corridor XIII is then almost certainly an after-thought and its only purpose seems to have been to provide sheltered connection between the wheystore and the school. It seems to have existed in some form at least as far back as 1589. In summary then, 17th century Skálholt appears to have consisted of three separate blocks which probably indicates a more dispersed set of buildings existed here in earlier times."
1680,1670.svg,The site remains as it was in 1670.
1690,1690.svg,"By 1690, the southern (service) and north-eastern (school) blocks had been joined by the extension of the corridor XIII, leaving the Bishops wing the only section still separate; by this time however, a new pair of rooms had been built in the space between the Bishops block and the western side of the service block. Structures XI and XII seem to have been built for the priest and his household, creating yet another, fourth block, which was also separate – but shared the courtyard with the Bishops residence. Contemporary with this was a modification to the pantry (XVIII), whose wall lines were shifted south – no doubt to accommodate the new Priests building.  A door on the north side of the pantry appears to have led outside, behind Structures XI and XII and probably was built so access to the pantry from the western side of the settlement was made easier, now the corridor was continuous. All of these changes probably happened under Bishop Þorður as archaeological material suggests a date of c. 1690. Otherwise, the rest of the settlement remains more or less as it was in 1670, apart from the usual repairs and maintenance activities, mostly evident in new floors."
1700,1700.svg,"A new kitchen (Structure X) was built c. 1700 to the west of the Priest’s rooms XI & XII), whose western entrance is now blocked off and a new northern doorway placed instead. In addition, a passageway connecting the male servants quarters and the Bishop’s dining room was also built. The oldest excavated traces of the Bishop’s living quarters date to this period."
1710,1700.svg,The site remains as it was in 1700.
1720,1720.svg,"A major change happens c. 1720; it is impossible to pinpoint when exactly, possibly a bit earlier but no later 1722 when the next inventory is taken as Jón Árnason takes over as Bishop. Given the quite substantial re-building of the Bishop’s block, this may have happened precisely over this period between 1720 and 1722 as there is nearly a two-year gap between the death of Jón Vidalín and the appointment of his successor. In this time, the old Bishop’s Residence seems to have been completely levelled and infilled and a new building constructed. It more or less followed the same design – a central axial corridor with side rooms, the Bishops quarters at the front (i.e. southern) end and servants and storage rooms at the back. However, for the first time we also see an access made between this wing and the others as the Bishops Dining room now has a connecting passage to the main axial corridor XIII. Now, all three main blocks are internally connected, the only isolated building now being the Priests Building (XII & XII). In addition, a nursery (VIII), which previously had been situated within the Bishop’s wing, was constructed behind the Priests house. Both the kitchen and the nursery were built by Jón Vídalín, probably sometime in the first decade of the 18th century. All other buildings on the site remain more or less as before."
1730,1730.svg,The site remains as it was in 1720 although the oldest excavated traces of the refectory date to this time.
1740,1740.svg,"In the 1740s, the priest had moved into the former male servants’ quarters, along with the bailiff and a little but later (in the 1760s), an access was opened into the main corridor from these rooms. At the same time, the former Priests house (XI & XII) was pulled down and a new building (IX) constructed over it; it is unclear what this was used for but possibly for the displaced male servants. Sadly, little of this new structure survived archaeologically, but these changes can also be dated to the early 1740s."
1750,1750.svg,"By the middle of the 18th century, the school, now probably more than a century old, has also been re-built but on the same footprint as before; both teachers’ rooms have however been pulled down and their quarters re-located into the loft above the classroom. From the inventories, we know the school was being rebuilt in 1747 so these changes coincide with the appointment of Bishop Ólafur Gíslason, though they may have been instigated earlier by Harboe who was acting Bishop in the five-year gap after the death of Jón Árnason.  Around the same time, the east side of the kitchen (X) was remodelled. It is for this period that we also have the first contemporary visual depiction of Skálholt, the map now preserved in the National Library. Although undated, our archaeological work and the information from the inventories has enabled us to date it to c. 1745/6, just prior to the re-building of the school but after the new building over the Priests house. Given this dating, the map may have been commissioned by Harboe, though if that were the case, one might have expected the annotation to be in Danish rather than Icelandic. The plan is useful as it indicates – assuming it can be trusted as a fair representation – the presence of chimneys, doors and windows, and with the latter, a distinction between glass windows (crossed squares) and those with stretched intestinal lining (circular). On the whole, the archaeological plan matches this depiction rather well, with the exception of the bailiff’s room at the back of the Bishops residence. On the drawing, it is depicted as a separate structure and staggered from the dining room, whereas archaeologically there seems no doubt the two rooms are part of the same, continuous structure. If the two rooms were not connected by a door and if this drawing is done partly from memory or the internal arrangement, that might explain the anomaly on the drawing."
1760,1760.svg,The site remains as it was in 1750 except for a passage joining the Bishop’s dining room (V) with the new building (IX).
1770,1760.svg,The site remains as it was in 1760.
1780,1780.svg,"In the final decades of the Bishops residence and school, the settlement has not changed much since the middle of the 18th century. What alterations that were made are subtle and minor. Access between the Bishop´s Residence and the school via the main corridor has been closed again, probably in the early 1780s, although a new access was created between the house built over the Priest’s house in the 1740s and the nursery while the passage between that house and the Bishop’s dining room was now blocked in again. There was also a reduction in the size of the wheystore (XV); throughout the time discussed here, it always held two sunken vats, but sometime, probably in the 1770s or early 1780s it was ‘halved’ and the southern vat removed. This change probably coincided with the construction of a new, small storage room (XVI) just to the south. Finally, in the very late 1770s or early 1780s, an infirmary (XXIX) is built, constructed over the infilled remains of the earlier assistant teacher’s room.  All three of these changes just described are within the same general area and may have been done at a similar time. These are the only major building works that seem to have taken place in the last period of the school and bishopric. All are depicted on the well-known map from 1784 which otherwise matches our archaeological plan very well, aside from the obvious liberties taken with making the site look more symmetrically aligned than it is. Despite having more of the appearance of a modern plan, in some ways it is less informative than the mid-18th century depiction whose three-dimensionality somehow adds more to the archaeological plan than the one from 1784. At the same time, we also have in this period the first artists sketches and paintings of Skálholt, which though show the settlement at a distance, nonetheless give a feel for the place that the 1784 plan also lacks. Clevelely 1772 painting shows a dense cluster of turf-roofed houses, while Dayes painting based on Baines’ sketch of 1789, suggests the use of timber exterior walls. However, what both paintings and the 1784 plan do show is the scale of the settlement, reminding us that our excavations only touched the core of it. Along the southern and western sides were numerous outbuildings, stores, workers cottages and so on which is easy to forget, when just focusing on the area exposed in our excavation."
1790,1780.svg,"On August 14th 1784, an earthquake struck the region causing substantial damage to many properties, including Skálholt. Reports of the earthquake damage describe the condition of the houses. One from 1784 discusses the Bishops residence and some of the outhouses; the Residence itself seems to have suffered very badly with all the rooms in various states of collapse including broken timbers and so on. A separate document from 1785 describes the school, which seems to have fared better; apart from the school dormitory which had completely fallen in, the school room, various service rooms and corridor are described as either usable or in fine condition. Part of this discrepancy between the two parts of the settlement may relate to the fact that the school and some of the service rooms are those buildings that had undergone the most substantial renovations prior to the earthquake and were therefore in better condition. Nonetheless, in 1786, it was decided to move the school and official residence of the bishop to Reykjavík and so ended more than seven centuries of an episcopal seat. During the 1790s, although damaged, most of the buildings probably still remained standing and so the site plan shows no major changes."
1800,1800.svg,"By 1800, the site had shrunk dramatically and now only the former Bishop’s wing remained occupied while both the school and service rooms were left to become ruins. Some re-modelling of the Bishops wing, especially of the western rooms seems to have occurred and the nursery (Structure VIII) was still in use (though possibly now as storage room), while the southern service rooms were used to dump hearth ashes and rubbish while the axial corridor was probably used to store hay. All of these changes reflect what we know from the written sources.  The last Bishop at Skálholt, Hannes Finnson, bought the property from the Church and used it as his private residence, moving back in in the fall of 1787, where he lived until his death in 1797. His widow Valgerður (who was only in her mid-20s when Hannes died) stayed on and even supervised the construction of a new church in 1802 to replace the now delapidated cathedral. A sketch by Richard Bright who accompanied the Hooker expedition from 1810 shows the site but at a distance; little useful detail is visible but it does show the new church and the rooftop of the main farmstead to the right.  More useful is a nice description of Skálholt at this time from William Hooker who camped at Skálholt briefly during his travels in 1809 and he gives us a short description of the place and his host, Valgerður (Hooker 1813): “… the immediate entrance to the small cluster of houses that composed this village, which was but a few years ago the residence of the bishops, and the capital of Iceland, was, if possible, still worse, being an extremely wet and boggy soil, interspersed with large pieces of rock. One good turf house, and three or four smaller ones are, besides the church, all that now remains of the town. … We had scarcely pitched our tents, when a handsome young widow, of the name of Joneson, richly dressed in the Icelandic fashion, came down and invited us to her house, where she set before us some Ren, or rye-pottage, in a turenne, and a basin of cream and sugar. It was one of the best Icelandic houses I had ever entered, and was, moreover, in every part remarkable for its extreme cleanliness, in which respect our hostess herself was no less conspicuous. The rooms were wainscotted and painted with blue and red, and there was a good library, belonging, however, to the scool of Bessestedr, the lector of which place, who was brother to Madame Joneson, frequently consulted it. The collection consisted chiefly of Icelandic books and manuscripts, relating to the political and ecclesiastical history of the country, mixed with extracts from such works as are most scarce in the island; among which I noticed several pages copied from the Linnæan Amænitates Academicæ. The farm, belonging to this house, was reckoned a considerable one, and had several buildings appropriated to the use of cattle; but of these, the floors are never covered with any sort of litter, so that the poor animals must have but a sorry bed on the bare rock. From the exceeding filthiness of the place, it seemed as if a dung-hill, near the outside of the building, was but seldom replenished.” (Hooker 1813: 186-7) Clearly Valgerður had maintained something of the settlement’s former glory, but it was short-lived. "
1810,1800.svg,"Extant remains from the 19th century are increasingly patchy and evidence for change, correspondingly limited. Archaeologically, the site looks the same as it was in 1800.  By 1812, the widow of the last bishop had sold Skálholt and moved on, and by 1816, the property had become divided into two farms with two households, based on census data. However, there is no indication of two farmsteads or dwellings and it is likely the two households lived under the same roof, i.e. the former Bishops’ wing. Some of the alterations seen archaeologically may relate to this change of ownership, but the dating is not precise enough to make any firm inferences. "
1820,1800.svg,The site remains as it looked in 1810.
1830,1800.svg,"The settlement seems to have remained occupied by two households throughout the first half of the nineteenth century; a census from 1835 shows a new farmer and the widow of one of the former farmers with some of her children. However, throughout the century, one of the household heads was often a local dignatory, including both a county sheriff (sýslumaður) and a parish head (hreppsjtóri). In 1834, a German-Danish painter Frederik Theodor Kloss visited Skálholt and made a sketch which shows the church and the roof tops of the settlement but is otherwise not very informative.  More usefully, from 1836 we have a map of the site drafted by Victor Lottin and a painting by Auguste Mayer, both of whom accompanied the Gaimard expedition to Iceland. Although the map is grossly inaccurate in terms of the relative location of the various buildings in the homefield, it does show the main farmstead in some detail and its layout corresponds quite well with the archaeological remains, which are only partially preserved. The plan also shows two sleeping lofts, which one presumes reflects the division into two households. The painting by Mayer seems to show the farm looking south-east, with Hekla in the background; to the left is the main farmhouse while to the right are various outhouses where the kitchen (Structure X) once stood. None of these latter seem to have left any traces archaeologically. The building in the centre is most probably the former nursery (Structure VIII) which according to the 1836 map, was used as a wool and meat store. The chimney with smoke coming from it, is probably from the building behind which was marked as a forge/smithy of which were found traces in a later phase (Structure XXXII)."
1840,1800.svg,The site remains as it looked in 1830.
1850,1850.svg,"By the middle of the nineteenth century, the archaeological remains of the settlement have become extremely patchy; remnants of two rooms in the main farmstead and the forge are all that can be ascertained with any confidence but it seems at least likely that the broad layout remained more or less the same as before. The 1850 census still lists two households living there. "
1860,1850.svg,"The site remains as it was in 1850 but it appears as if only one household was now resident. Although no plans or sketches/paintings exists of the farm from the later 19th century, we are fortunate to have a quite detailed description by one Bjarni Guðmundsson who describes the farm in 1865 (ÍB 959 8vo, pp.13-15): “The state of the farmhouse is now very different to what it had been, being very impoverished and decrepit except for two sturdy houses at the easternmost end of the farm buildings, next to the hill where the school once stood, in front of the churchyard.  In that place there is now a large ruin fully overgrown and covered with grass in summer. East of the farm itself lies a hollow that lines up more or less directly to the churchyard and the middle of the church, which marks the route of a subterranean passage - an underground structure where distinguished persons could walk to the church in the winter – in bad weather and possibly at other times. The farmhouse is a row of buildings facing the midday sun, but another row of buildings stands opposite to this on the farmyard, facing north: namely, a store room, smithy and a drying shed with other shacks. Alongside these buildings lies a narrow vegetable garden from east to west.  The country road follows this eastwards and from the west through the farm tracks to the farmyard. In front of the vegetable garden is a mound with large and ancient ruins, which testify to the many buildings and large houses which once stood here, and from the Annals [of Espólín] it is to be understood that this is where the printshop was and other structures.  From here there is an even slope to the hayfield and a view both beautiful and impressive”.  This description more or less matches the Lottin plan from 1836 suggesting little had changed thirty years later. "
1870,1850.svg,The site is unchanged since 1860.
1880,1880.svg,"There are only slight traces left now, and these probably belong to a a new farmhouse built in the 1870s or 1880s. In the 1880 census, there are two households listed again and it remains divided like this into the next century and it is possible that the resumption of a two-household property coincided with the construction of a new farmhouse."
1890,1880.svg,The site is unchanged since 1880.
1900,1900.svg,"Within a couple of years either side of the turn of the century, some major changes occurred to the site. In 1897/8, the old farmhouse was demolished and a new timber house erected with a stone cellar (Structure XXXV). Archaeologically, the cellar was the only trace left of this new house.  Around the same time, a byre and some stables were erected to the east of the farmstead built in the 1870s, though little trace of any of these buildings have survived. In 1902, a new barn was erected between the byre and stables. A photograph from the first years of the twentieth century gives a nice view of the farm, just after the barn, stables and byre had been built showing all the structures just listed. "
1910,1900.svg,The site is unchanged since 1900.
1920,1900.svg,The site is unchanged since 1910.
1930,1930.svg,"The eastern farmhouse was demolished in 1927 (Karlsson 1980: 117); it is still shown on the farm maps from 1920 and a photograph from 1924 and while the census from 1920 shows two household still resident, by 1930 there was only one. "
1940,1940.svg,The barn was concreted on the inside and the byre re-built in 1936/7 while the stables were either converted or replaced by a tool shed in the 1930s.  
1950,1940.svg,"The site is unchanged since 1940. The end of the site comes in the 1950s; first the barn burnt down in 1952, then in 1958, after the excavations of the cathedral site had finished, the western farmhouse was pulled down and the area levelled. Two unattributed maps of the site from around the middle of the century exist, one probably from the 1930s/1940s and the other from the early 1950s show the footprints of these various buildings."
