Documentary inventories from 1674 and 1698 refer to a whey store with two vats or ‘sýruker í jörðu’, and this was probably built sometime between 1630 and 1674. The earlier plan shows a small room oriented north-south with a central entrance from the main corridor which matches the excavated room [887]. In its original form, the whey store [887] was a large, two-celled room with a central passage [1270] leading into the main axial corridor (Structure XIII; [751]). The room was 4.4m long and 2.7m wide with stone faced walls [2760], divided into two square cells each 2.8 x 2.3m, cut down to an extant depth of 1.9m, though the southern cell was deeper than the northern one ([1102]/[1103]). Both cells had originally contained wooden vats for holding whey, but these had been dismantled when the room was re-built in a later phase. Based on surviving traces, their construction appears to have consisted of a mixed red/pink/white clay lining ([982]/[1030]/[1091]) along the sides and base of the cut, with timber cladding forming the inside of the vat. Textiles and horsehair had been used as caulking to seal any gaps.   A very narrow ledge ran around the perimeter of the vats, surfaced with turf ([1019], [1072]) and covered with ashes ([844], [1016], [1010]); its possible the wooden lining originally extended a little higher than this surface, but otherwise the ledge could have provided a surface for throwing planks across the vat, either for walking over and/or covering them. The ledge however certainly provided a surface for the roof supports – at each corner and at each end of a center ridge between the vats were postpads on which would have rested timbers for holding up the roof, three pairs in total. The passage [1270] leading into the room from the corridor was 0.85m wide and 3.75m long, with well preserved walls and a flagged floor ([864/1075]). No closely dateable finds were retrieved from any of these deposits, and the best TPQ came from ceramics in the passage, which dated from c. 1650, but with a wide date range.  In 1630, a wheystore (sýruklefi) is mentioned but it is hard to know of this is the same structure; it contained barrels and a large container which could hold the volume of 60 barrels. The first reliable mention which can be correlated with the archaeological remains is from 1674 where it is described as two bays long, containing two dug-down vats and in good condition. However it appears to have been re-built/renovated in 1693 as the 1698 inventory describes the same layout (but now three bays long); it also has a door with a latch. In this inventory, the building is called the drink store (Drÿckiarklefinn) but the word dryckur was commonly used to refer to whey drink. There is no change in the 1722 inventory but by 1744 it is described as old so by 1747 it has been repaired and in good condition again. In 1759, it has acquired a new door and in the list of moveable, two whey vats (sýruker) are listed. The drawing from 1745/6 shows a building with a central passage off the main corridor called the Sýruklefinn which matches the archaeological plan very well. It seems to be absent from the 1764 inventory – possibly it was being re-built at the time.",Wheystore,sýruklefi,t

It had been heavily damaged by the cutting of deep foundations for the hay barn (Structure II). Nonetheless, three successive sequences of floor either side of a stone-lined and capped drain were well preserved (S20.1-20.3). The walls [748] of the room were however very poorly preserved; in a few places, the basal course of stone and turf survived, but in others, nothing except a disturbed spread of turf and stone. Their thickness is estimated at c.2m. Preservation was best at the eastern end. The eastern wall is probably part of an earlier structure, and in fact seems to be the outer edge of the western wall of Structure XXI, suggesting this latter building may be older than the dormitory. However, there are clearly earlier structures beneath both buildings (designated as Structure 0 or S0) but what was observed was so fragmentary and partial any relationships must remain speculative. In all, the building was c.9.1 m long by c.3.6m wide and substantially lower than the rest of the complex; at the eastern end, the room stepped up to enter the school room (Structure XXI) as there was no obvious doorway, while at the west end it either stepped up too or the corridor at this time must have been much lower (see Structure XIII; the height difference is c. 0.5m) In this earliest phase, it does not appear as if there was a drain, or if there was it was rebuilt in the next phase (see S20.2, below).   The primary (excavated) floor [436] was composed of compacted birch bark and twigs, possibly stained with charcoal. Its northwestern corner was completely truncated by the haybarn and its southern edge had clearly also been somewhat nibbled away. A later drain (see next phase) also cut a narrow section out of the centre of the floor. No obvious features were identified in this room. On the north side in the middle was the remains of a possible upright post/stake [677] but it was not very clear. In the south eastern corner of the building at the base of the floor sequence was an area of flagstones [736] associated with an ash deposit [742] and a turf patch [741]. It is possible a stove was originally located here, although this feature may even belong to an earlier phase of activity. A stove tile was found in the floor layer associated with this phase.  Dating from the floor came from clay pipes and ceramic, both of which indicate an early 17th century date with a TPQ of 1650. Given the cumulative nature of the floor, the TPQ should be read with some flexibility. However, a single clay pipe find from the upper part of this floor [368] returned a TPQ of 1767 which is likely to be intrusive. Indeed, the dating of all three of the earliest phases of this structure contains material of a wide date range which might relate to disturbance and mixing caused by renovations and cleaning. It suggests that the temporal integrity of finds in these phases must be treated with caution and the risk of finds contamination high.",School Dormitory,skólaskáli,t

The structure was 3.2m wide and at least 8.2m long north-south, its stone-faced and turf/earth filled walls [1058] not very well preserved, as essentially the same stones had been robbed/re-used during re-building in a later phase. The walls were though c. 1.8m thick. The north and south ends appear to have had wooden gables but the south end is more disturbed and probably missing sections of wall which would have made the building a little longer (c. 9.2m). At the south end in the centre was a solid stone cobbled surface [1046], which may be a platform for some kind of furniture. There was a connecting door/short passage in the centre of the west wall to the adjacent building (Structure XX), while on the opposing eastern wall, opposite the door, was a recessed fireplace [153]. In its original construction the fireplace appears to have comprised an L-shaped structure of stone [1107] set far back into a deep U-shaped recess, 2.75m long by 0.7m wide; there was a space of c. 1.1m in front of the fireplace within this recess, which was laid with flagstones [1112]. Stratified remains of multiple firings [1110], [1109], [1097], [1093]) were found within the fireplace, with fuel residues of both chracoal and peatash present. The area within the fireplace was 1.3 by 0.4m. No close dating was associated with the fireplace.  The primary floor was a turf and stone layer [947] which extended over most of the room except for an area 1.5 x 2m in the southeast corner. As excavated, there were stratigraphic problems insofar as ash layers in the fireplace seemed to interdigitate with the floor [947]. It is likely that there has been a lot of disturbance here, a fact supported by the very unstable nature of the deposits beneath the floor layer (which may be due to voids between rubble or stones in these underlying, unexcavated layers). Two such layers were excavated ([1078], [1122]) and it is unclear if they are associated with this room or earlier occupation. A large depression [923], 1 x 1.4m and 0.2m deep was filled with mixed turf and floor material [920] lay in the centre of the floor at the northern end of the room between two postpads; is uncertain what this feature represents but it could mark the removal/robbing of some structural or other feature.  Through the centre of the building, running east-west was a linear channel [1041] which was 2.5m long, 06m wide and 13 cm deep. At its eastern end, the channel opened out into a larger, irregular square hollow, just in front of the fireplace and the whole feature was filled with ashy, lensed deposits. During excavation, this whole feature (designated [1017]) was interpreted as a drain/sump, but the fill is not particularly suggestive of such and nor were there the usual side stones one sees in other drains on the site. Rather this probably represents an eroded surface due to heavy foot traffic between the fireplace and the entrance, which was later surfaced with flagstones. This area was very disturbed and it is probable that this feature continued in use into the next phase, especially given the dating associated with its fill.  Sealing the turf floor were fragmentary patches of a black, charcoal/ash floor ([894]), which survives best on the eastern side of the structure. A TPQ from this floor returned a date of c.1650. Localised floor levelling repairs were also identified in the northeast corner ([917], [918], [909]), suggesting this phase probably represents a fairly long time period.  The 1674 describes this structure – the school room (Scholinn) as seven bays long with panelled walls and benches all around; the room is clearly divided into an upper and lower class, but whether this was physically marked with a partition is unclear though the floor level certainly sloped down north to south. Based on a later map, the upper class would have been north of the fireplace and the lower class, south. The upper class was also provided with shelves (‚med slidrum‘) for storing papers. There was a hinged door into the room, and an inglenook (Önsstofan) is briefly mentioned.",School Room,skóli,t

As a result, any interpretation must be open to revision. Based on the excavated deposits however, it appears as if there was an original structure on the same alignment as structure XXIII to the west, whose floor layers survive as a strip truncated/sealed by the later south wall of structure V. These floors abutted the remains of a southern wall ([2552), [2381]) which aligns with the southern wall of Structure XXIII. The exposed/extant floor was only observed and excavated in a narrow strip c.0.6m wide. The base of this strip was laid with a flagstone surface [2360], over which were a sequence of overlapping turf layers, with occasional flagstones ([2358], [2346], [2339], [1331]). This was associated with finds returning a TPQ of 1700. Over this was an organic layer with lots of birch twigs [1323] , which was overlain by another organically-rich deposit [1434]. The primary organic layer was associated with a TPQ of 1650. A peatash dump [1427] lay at the eastern end, while above this was an organic layer [1421], rich in bone fragments; a TPQ of 1700 was associated with these. At the western end was small organic/charcoal layer [2370]. All of these layers seemed to abut the walls either side rather than go beneath them, but equally the walls could have truncated them. All of them resemble floor layers in terms of their composition.   Based on its location, any such structural remains in this area are likely to belong to the Bishops Former Living Quarters (Biskups badstofan gamla) described in the 1674 inventory as six bays long with wall panels, hinged door and in good condition. Included in the room was at table and bench as well as another, presumably smaller table and dresser for drinks.",Bishops Former Living Quarters,Biskupsbaðstofa (fyrri),

The structure was c. 12.2m long and 3.6m wide with its northern wall surviving to a depth of 1.0m, the southern one 0.7m [2762]. It is likely the building had an internal wooden partition dividing it into two rooms. The building had two doors, one at the western end where originally, there was also a timber gable end leading to the outside and another at the eastern end, via a short passage [2326] 2.5m long and 0.8m/1.2m wide leading into Structure XVIII. Altogether, eight phases to this building were identified. However, at the end of the last season of excavation, an earlier floor was exposed – but remained unexcavated [3023]. This floor continued under the northern wall of the building suggesting that this wall has probably been re-built and was brought inward in the first phase identified here. Certainly what is called the first phase in this publication, is clearly not the primary phase of the building which must have an older history.  A floor layer [2953]/[2975] covered whole room but was thickest at the east end while at the west, there were stone flags on the surface. A further area of flags [3002] lay near the middle of the room. A wooden sill beam lay in situ across passage [2326]. The floor was composed of trampled ash and included lots of burnt bone. Against the south wall at the east end, discrete deposits of peatash [3001] and charcoal [3009] were both sealed by the main floor, suggesting they belong to an earlier phase. A micromorphology sample (s. 359) was taken from the floor layer for thin-sectioning and analysis. About 10 layers were identified and were much richer in large bone and charcoal fragments than the upper layers examined in another thin-section (see S17.6). There were only three or four thin blackish brown floor surfaces with a massive to platy structure due to trampling. The layers in between seem to be made up of turf, massive amounts of wood chippings, fragments of tree branches and other organic material as well as large charcoal and bone fragments (1-5 mm in length) with elongated fragments aligned fully horizontally due to compaction/trampling. Unburned wood chips were mostly identified as coniferous wood while the charcoal fragments were mostly birch and willow (rare). Low level of disturbance by soil fauna was present and excrement was identified as mostly coming from mites, especially found within larger porous bone fragments. A stone-lined drain [2960] ran the whole length of the room along the northern side, snaking out through the western entrance. The drain comprised a (probable) cut, sides stones and turf ([3000], [2963]), upper and lower fills ([2999], [2992], [2958]) and disturbed capstones (and sides stones) [2961]. The main floor [2953] had clearly accumulated against and over the drain. In addition, both rooms had ovens/fireplaces. In the western room [2763], the fireplace [2730] survived only partially – it was largely destroyed when it was re-built in the next phase. The floor also seems to have been disturbed in this area. The original fireplace consisted of truncated peatash deposits ([2957], [2956], [2952]) around its edges and was associated with a TPQ of 1670/80 from a clay pipe bowl. In the eastern room [2764], fire place [2951] (0.6 x0.75m) lay in the northeast corner of the room and had two in situ hearth deposits ([2996]) over a cleaning cut [2998] and a peatash rake-out dump [3017] just to the west. No dateable finds were retrieved from this phase.  Given the poor dating, it is difficult to correlate this structure with the documented sources. The earliest definite reference to this building is from the 1674 inventory and mentions two rooms: a meat store (kiotaskemman) and a kitchen (eldhusid). Given the order of description, the meat store is the easternmost room and the kitchen the western one; moreover the eastern room is described as quite large – seven bays, as opposed to the four of the kitchen. Despite minor changes, this layout more or less remains the same into and throughout the 18th century. There are two possibilities here; either Structure XVII includes both the meat store and the kitchen, or only the meat store, in which case the kitchen lies outside the area of excavation. Given the documented sizes, at 12.2m long this would mean either short bays of 1.1m or wide bays of 1.7m, either of which is possible. Nonetheless, in a later phase, there are nine pairs of postpads suggesting eight bays – which matches the description from 1722. Moreover, there were no obvious partitions observed archaeologically, though the denser paving at the western end could indicate a division into a small western room and a larger eastern one. Perhaps the most relevant evidence here concerns the subsequent histories of the two rooms in the inventories. The kitchen appears to have been built in 1672 and remained in use until c. 1760 when it was replaced by/converted into a drying shed, while the meat store continues through to the 1780s and archaeologically, there is no indication of the western half being abandoned. In conclusion, Structure XVII almost certainly relates only to the meat store with the kitchen remaining unexcavated. From the 1674 description the meat store had a wooden gable at one end with a door and this probably means the western end, which futher suggests the kitchen must have been a separate structure. The description remains the same in 1698 but the building is now described as worn. ",Meat Store,kjötskemma,t

Based largely on the inventories, it does not seem as if this structure was connected to the main corridor (Structure XIII) in its earliest phase but rather a wide aisle separated this building from the refectory (Structure XIX) further to the west. The aisle would probably have had wooden gable walls at each end with doors at one or both ends.  The northern edge of the building was not fully excavated as a later rebuild resulted in its north wall being set further south than in the original construction , probably by c. 0.5m if one assumes the drain is centrally placed. This would have made the building c. 3.3m wide. The southern wall [1894] only survived as a foundation course as its upper part had been robbed and demolished during a later rebuilding (see S18.6 below). In the interests of safety/stability (and aesthetics), this later north wall was not removed during the excavation. The primary (unexcavated floor) in this structure was constructed with substantial cobbles ([2554], [2556/7]); it remains unknown how many (if any) earlier phases of this structure exist. Along the northern edge of the room ran a drain [2488], consisting of sidestones [2555] and capstones [2489], with a drain fill [2493]. At the eastern end of the room was a cobbled platform [2046], which probably supported a sill beam for a wooden partition wall separating this room from the axial corridor. Associated with the floor were three barrel pits, [2452] in the southwest corner and another [3033], slightly larger to the east. The third barrel pit [2447] was twice the size of the other two and replaced the easternmost one. Remains of preserved wood staves and hoops as well as copper alloy clench bolts were retrieved from both pits. The third barrel pit was distinctive also in being clay lined and is clearly reminiscent of the whey vats excavated in structure XV.  Barrel pit [2452] was defined by a cut [2483] 0.85m in diameter but only 0.18m deep, set within or related to a localized levelling layer [2484]; in the base of the cut was a dark silty layer [2480] over which lay remains of the base of the stave barrel [2479]. The rest of the barrel had probably been removed as there were no further traces of it. About 1.3m to the east of the last one was the slightly larger [3033], c. 1.3m in diameter and c. 0.8m deep; most of this barrel pit had been truncated by the later barrel pit [2447] which replaced it. The original pit was defined by a cut [2562] but no traces of the barrel itself remained; the cut was backfilled [2530] with turf, probably after the installation of the later barrel [2447].   The cut [2559] of this later barrel pit was c. 1.9m in diameter and 0.9m deep, but although a larger cut, the barrel inside it was much smaller c.1.1m in diameter. Remains of the base and sides of barrel [2518] were found in situ, as well as a clay lining [2519] behind the barrel; between the clay lining and the edge of the cut was a thick backfill layer [2558].This is an unusual construction and two explanations present themselves; either a much larger barrel was initially intended or installed in the cut, or the thick infill between the barrel and the cut was an attempt to increase impermeability – either of the contents of the barrel leaking out or (more likely) ground water seeping in. Indeed, this may have been the reason why the original barrel pit [3033] was replaced. Also, the westernmost barrel pit [2452] was cut significantly shallower than these two, suggesting groundwater was less of a problem at this depth. The clay lining around the barrel would support this second hypothesis.   No close dating came from any of the deposits in this phase. The inventory from 1674 describes the building (Bur) as in good condition having recently been repaired; it was 6 bays long and a door separated this from the adjacent meat store (Structure XVII) as well as having a main door, presumably at the eastern end.",Pantry,búr,t

A turf floor levelling layer ([739], [740], [1113]) was laid over the primary floor, with a TPQ of 1660/1670. Over this was a cumulative floor [435] of birch bark and twigs as before. Most of the dating from this floor returned dates from the mid 17th century, but two dates had TPQs of 1700, one of 1720 and another of 1750. These derive from different locales across the floor, but the latter two came from more disturbed areas ([411], [448]). It either suggests the stratigraphic integrity of this floor is compromised as with the previous phase. A micromorphology sample (s.52) was taken through this floor and thin-sectioned and analysed. The section revealed a very low activity area up against the northern wall, no sign of trampling, and composed of a six or seven layer sequence of redish brown organic rich turf. Rare to occasional inclusions of charcoal and bone fragments rarely larger than 1 mm occurred as well as slithers of hair, most likely horse hair. Larger charcoal fragments (> 1 mm) were mostly identified as birch (common) and willow (rare).   Through the centre of the room ran a drain [308], which cut the primary floor [436]. It started just in front of the eastern wall and ran at least 8.7m westward; its western extent was not found as it continued beneath unexcavated deposits. It probably linked up with a drain system in the western part of the complex – probably an earlier phase of the main axial corridor (see Structure XIII, S13.1). All of the drain capstones were missing (probably removed during the construction of the haybarn), but some large flags [293] lay along the edges which may represent disturbed capstones or part of a flagged floor. The side stones and fill were well preserved. The sides [311] were constructed from  large basalt blocks (c. 15 x 40 x 30 cm) set upright to create a channel 25-35cm wide and 45-50cm deep with stones also lining the base [312]. The drain appared to slope from east to west, consistent with the terminus at the east end and a probably connection to a drain system at the west. The stones all lay within a cut [735] which was 0.5m wide and c.0.25m deep. The primary drain fill [272] was excavated in 1m segments and was composed of rich organic silts. A TPQ from this primary fill returned a date of c. 1730/1740 but as with the floor, most of the dated finds fell within the late 17th and early 18th century. Given the continued use of the drain in the next phase, this TPQ probably relates to its terminal period. At the western end for about 2m, natural silts [292] had sealed this primary fill.   The inventory from 1674 describes the dormitory (Scóla skálinn) as five bays long, with panelled walls and eight beds on each side of the room; it is described as being sturdy and in good shape but with old timber. There is a hinged door into the room. The room this refers to was obviously built/repaired some time before this. Sometime during Bishop Þorlákssons encumbency (1674-1697) the building was modified for by 1698 it is described as well made, the same size (five bays) but now with ten box beds (with doors) on each side and the main door has a lock.",School Dormitory,skólaskáli,t

Unfortunately, the eastern half of the room was completely truncated by the haybarn (Structure II), bisecting the room almost perfectly in half; what remained was the eastern part including most of the doorway into the passage [106]. The extant part measured c. 2.5m wide and 2.5m long, and given its description as three bays long, it would seem only the last bay/one third has been truncated indicating an original length of c.3.8m. It was in very bad condition, much of its walls [1059/847/861] damaged probably due to the building of a later structure over this (Structure XXIX), although substantial and artefact-rich floors survived. The extant walls were c. 1.4-1.6m thick. The interior was covered with a turf levelling layer  ([1008], [1039], [1045], [1051], [1054]). A TPQ of 1630 came from this layer, though two finds also returned TPQ‘s of 1700. The entrance from the room into the passage [106] was equally disturbed, but remains of an intact flagstone surface [1171] was found which is probably contemporary with the primary floor [1011] which consisted of scattered flagstones and charcoal/ash floor with wood chips. The base of a stave vessel <4489> lay embedded in the floor in the centre of the room, cut in half by the haybarn construction; it made from coniferous wood with a diameter of 380mm. A TPQ of 1674 came from a clay pipe in this floor.    The 1674 inventory called this building the teacher‘s house (locatshusid), which is where the assistant teacher – presumably of the lower/younger class – resided. It is described as three bays long, furnished with two beds, a table and a bench and in good shape.  In 1698, it seems to only be two bays long (but this is ambiguous), has panelled walls and a lockable door besides two beds, a table and chair.",Assistant Teachers Quarters,locats hús,t

It lay beneath Structure IV. The walls [2522] were built of stone faced turf along the north and south sides, 1.7m thick, while the east end would have had a timber gable and the west end a timber screen fronting on to a probable corridor/passage [2906]. It was 10.5m long and 4m wide. A substantial timber sill beam [2796] was in situ at the eastern end marking a timber gable. The outer edge of the eastern structure was also constructed with a curved face of stones [2846]. This is probably contemporary with [2003] which is the original outer wall of the corridor (Structure XIII). An organic, wood chip/twig fill ([2847], [1417/2845]) had accumulated between these two walls. On the south wall, another passage (Structure XXVII) connected this building directly with Structure XXIV to the south.   The interior of the building was surfaced with flagstones set in a clayish turf and charcoal layer ([2842]/[2877]), over which was laid/had accumulated a trampled ashy floor with further flags [2800]. The TPQ from these floors was 1733, but this is probably intrusive from the next phase; most of the finds point to a TPQ of 1700/1710 while the earliest TPQ was 1672. A line of flagstones at the eastern end may mark a narrow chamber 1.2m wide partition off from the rest of the building. However, in the southeastern corner of the room the floor had been laid with flagstones [2792] which extend over this line; this possibly represents a surface to rest a barrel or a piece of furniture. It is possible there was a partition at the end of this surface – it is also where a drain  stops. This would have made the chamber 2.6m long – a rather more practical size. It is also possible the structure was divided just west of the passage (Structure XXVII) as another line of flags seem to mark out the base for a sill beam. This latter would have split the structure into two rooms, the western room being 3.9m long and the eastern room 6.5m long (or 3.9m and 2.6m if also divided at the east end). A few postpads [2632] were identified along the southern edge of the building spaced c. 1.5m apart.  A drain [2732] snaked through the building, running from the east end where platform [2792] ended and draining down into the corridor [2646] (Structure XXVI). Two off-shoots ([2724], [2725]) into the axial line of the drain [2723] ran from the south wall. The drain itself had sidestones [3025], mostly in situ, set within the make-up layer [2842]. A primary fill ([2733/2734]) was excavated in the drain; a TPQ of 1667 came from this fill. No capstones survived – they had all been robbed when the room was levelled.  The 1674 inventory calls this building the Boys Hall (Sveina skälinn) and it was seven bays long with eight beds (three of which belonged to the Bishop for his family) and a hinged door.  It is well built and strong. This was presumably sleeping quarters for servants working for the Bishop at Skálholt.",Male Servants Quarters,sveinaskáli,t

Only a tiny segment of this building fell into the excavation area and both this room and the passage/aisle were only exposed and recorded, but not excavated except for a section of the south wall ([2921], [2950]). A passage through its south wall led to Structure XXIV.  According to the 1674 and 1698 inventories, this building would be the Hall Stores (Skalaskemma); in 1674 it is described as eight bays long with a locked door; it also had a chamber in the front which was also with a lockable door. In 1698 it is only six bays long, having been recently repaired by Bishop Þorláksson. The building was later replaced by Structure III.",Hall Store room,skalaskemma,

It was partially excavated by Kristján Eldjárn in 1954-58, his trench clipping the east side [160], and he seems to have just exposed the walls and the passage into the room. Since this room is not depicted on the 1784 map, he was unsure what to make of it and suggested it may have been a door to the outside. Guðmundur Ólafsson also dug into this room in 1984 [009]. Based on Eldjárn´s plan and our own, this room was aligned north-east/south-west, with access into it from the passageway to the church. The room as excavated measured 2.8m long and 3.1m wide, but extended a little further north beyond the limit of excavation. Based on the inventories which describe a structure two bays long, this cannot have been far and in fact the northern side of the door probably marks the northern edge, suggesting a roughly square room of c. 3.1 x 3.1m. The walls were well preserved [1053], surviving to a maximum height of 0.75m, 1.8m thick on the west side and 1.4m on the south. They were built over a turf levelling/infill layer [1027], which was unexcavated as it continued beneath the walls of the room. The primary floor layer [988] was artefact-rich, and contained finds giving a TPQ of 1650. Several postpads [986] survived around the edges of the room while a number of possible stakeholes were also identified.   The 1674 inventory refers to this building as the School master‘s house (Scholameistarahusid) and is described as two bays long with panelled walls and a hinged door, furnished with two beds, a table and benches.

15,C.1,1670,1720,,"South of the Bishops wing was a large open area [1257] which was roughly cobbled/flagged, although it is unclear to what extent this was an intentionally laid surface as opposed to just stony ground. It seems likely however from what has survived that the intentionally paved areas were just along the front of these structures in a band c. 1.2m wide. Only at the southern edge were earlier traces of this yard excavated, surviving under Structure X. At the base of this sequence is a large area or levelled turf and stone [2922], over which a series of turf and stone flags had been laid ([2722], [2729], [2635], [2790], [2779]; [2583], [2680], [2608]); the flagstones were particularly large and well laid just in front of the doorway into passage [1608] which led into the two Structures XI and XII.  A TPQ from one of these deposits gave a date of 1667 while another gave a date of 1730. These probably closely reflect the lower and upper brackets for dating of this surface. ",Courtyard,hlað,t

In barrel pit [2452], the same happened: the barrel was mostly removed and the pit backfilled with mixed turf [2456]. A TPQ of 1685 came from ceramics in the backfill of the larger barrel pit [2447]. Over the whole interior of the building, a new flagstone surface [2369] was laid over the original floor and sealed all the backfilled barrel pits. It is likely the drain [2488] was still active at this time. The closing of the barrel pits is interesting and may suggest a complete change in storage management. Sunken barrels are a notable feature of Icelandic domestic storage techniques with origins at least as far back as medieval times and a recent survey indicates their main period of construction and use dates to the 13th-16th centuries. At Reykholt, an excavated pantry with similar sunken barrels was in use between the 14th and early 17th century and possibly over the 17th century, such features ceased to be built and used in Iceland.",Pantry,búr,t

The north wall was very confusing and badly disturbed, comprising a series of turf, soil and stone deposits ([337], [1463]/[1464], [1467], [1483], [1470], [1458], [1457], [1455]) include one charcoal floor-like deposit at the top of the sequence ([1451]). A TPQ of 1650 was associated with the uppermost of these disturbed wall layers. Originally, it seems there was only one doorway into the room, that in the southern wall, which led into passage [421]. The thickness of the walls varied, being c. 3m around the perimeter and 3.8m between Structure XI and XII.  The inside of the building was surfaced with turf deposits. A central aisle [2756] was defined by some flagstones [1536] and charcoal layers ([1356], [1522], [1526], [1531]). Charcoal layer [2127] lay beneath all of these and may belong to an earlier phase of activity. A TPQ of 1690/1700 was associated with this primary layer. The eastern side of the room was covered with multiple turf deposits ([1471], [1472], [1474], [1489], [1496], [1517], [1530], [1536], [1544]) with occasional flagstones, one of which ([1513]) is associated with a postpad; many of the flags form a distinct demarcation of the easternmost bay of the room, suggesting this may have been a separate chamber [2757] from the rest of the building [2758]. Two of the turf levelling layers ([1488], [1509]) appeared to extend into the area of the northern wall but given the disturbance to the wall here and the ambiguity of the limits of these deposits, this is probably not an original feature – although they could mark the area of a stairs to an upper storey. The western side of room [2758] was simpler and consisted solely of multiple turf layers ([1554], [1558] [1557], [1560]) sealing a compact layer of clay [1567] against the south wall which in turn sealed a charcoal floor [1568]).  In the centre of the western side of the room was a deep, stone-lined pit [3031] from which a drain [1282] ran. The pit was 0,5 x 0,6m square and extended down 0,6m; the upper 25cm of construction comprised turf and flagstones but the main sides of the pit was built from stone blocks. There was no stone base to the feature, rather the lowest course of side stones appears to have been laid on a very compact, clayey layer, which remained unexcavated. The pit was covered with a capstone. The fill ([1602], [1593]) was fairly ‘clean’ suggesting this may have been no more than a sump to control drainage of groundwater during heavy rains. Alternatively, it may have been a privy – if it held a wooden container which was regularly cleaned out. The drain [1282] in this room, fed out south from this feature into a passage [421], and then turned west into the passage [1608], which runs into an outside yard. The drain appears to be contemporary with the primary phase, though it likely continued in use with the next phase of flagged floor. The drain itself was of usual construction: sidestones [1369] and capstones [1267] with a cut [1707] and upper and lower fills ([1364], [1366]).   Apart from the central aisle, no other ash floors were identified in the primary phase of this structure; it is possible that the floors were covered with wooden boards, but these are not mentioned in the inventories, so it is more likely that the floors originally had flagstones (as in the passages and in later phases of the rooms) which were robbed/re-used when the building was repaired.  Passage [421] was a narrow corridor between Structures XI and XII and into which the drain from Structure XI ran. The passage was 4.2m long and 1.3m wide but widened out to 2.2m at the south end with a dog-legged niche c.0.9m wide and 1.2m long. This niche is discussed under Structure XII below, but it may have formed part of a small inglenook. The surface of passage [421] was flagged ([1194]/[401]) along its length, the northern section of which doubled as capstones for the drain [1282] (sidestones: [1214]; cut: [1708]; fills: [1689], [1691]). The drain only ran about half the length of this passage, turning west into the adjoining passage [1608]. The drain and floor had been constructed into a turf make-up layer ([1700]/[1701]) which abutted the walls [1711] of the passage. Coming off at a right angle to passage [421] on the west was a similar passage [1608], c. 4.1m long and 1m wide. This passage led directly into the kitchen (Structure X) in its earliest phase, though the kitchen was built later and originally the structure probably led outside onto a yard surface which lies unexcavated under the main courtyard [1257]. The floor in this passage consisted of drain capstones [1674], most of which seem to have been robbed. The drain ran through the passage, its sidestones [1682] mostly in situ, set in a cut [1709].  Upper and lower drains fills were excavated ([1694], [1696]). Along the sides of the drain was turf packing ([1673]/[1700]) over which the charcoal floor lay. The walls [1711] of both passages were in variable condition; most of the stones from passage [421] survived in situ but none from passage [1608].  This structure is first mentioned in the 1698 inventory so it was built sometime in the period 1674-1698; based on archaeological dating, probably closer to the latter date. It is described as a living quarters (baðstofa), five bays long and panelled walls all around with a bed chamber furnished with a bed, table, bench and shelves and one glass window and with a lockable door on the south side; the other part of the building has benches and a glass window (with several broken panes). There is a loft above with one bed and one small glass window. A corridor three bays long leads from this room into the adjacent building (Structure XII); the corridor is also panelled and has a small inglenook (kindingarkofa) with a lockable door. The main entrance from outside and into the corridor is three bays long and has double doors, one with a lock and the other with a latch. The archaeological plan matches this description quite well – the corridor [421] and the entrance passage [1608] are both very clear and although the division in the main building into two rooms is more ambiguous, it seems likely that the eastern room is the bed chamber, where there was also a ladder up to the loft. The inglenook in the corridor [421] presumably relates to the dog-leg niche found at the south end, adjacent to Structure XII. It was probably later removed as no mention of if appears in the 1722 inventory.",Living Quarters,Baðdstofa,t

The 1722 inventory implies the passage [421] was shortened by one bay, which would accord with this change. The eastern arm of the northern wall has a dog-leg just east of the entrance. Its southern wall and edge were completely truncated (either in the 19th or 20th century), but the remaining walls ([1637]/[1411]/[1261]/[1249]/[447]) were more or less intact if somewhat disturbed.   The interior was well preserved and included a fairly thick charcoal floor [1329]/[1396] and postpads [1414] for roof-supporting timbers. No primary turf levelling layer was excavated and possibly earlier phases of this room remain unexcavated. The pads survived best at the two ends of the room, creating a near continuous sill plate; only a few pads along the long walls remained in situ, specifically three in the northeastern section, spaced about 1.1m apart. It is likely 8 pairs of posts spanned the width of the room. Several timber planks [1340] also occurred within the floor, which are almost certainly the remains of floorboards. There were two distinct phases of floor, but they were excavated as one; evidence of repairs is suggested by the insertion of probable secondary postpads [1375] with turf levelling beneath [1382] along the northwestern part of the room. As such, this phase probably covers a fairly long time period. The TPQ from these floors returned a date of c.1730/1740, but by far most of the material dates to the later 17th century suggesting a long-term accumulation.  In the corner formed by the dog-leg along the northern wall was a sunken pit for a small barrel or cask [438] – just to the right of the entrance as one leaves the room or left as one enters. This seems to have replaced an earlier inglenook, though no real traces of this survives (see S.XI.1). The pit [440] was circular c. 0.5m in diameter and 0.45m deep, backfilled with a mixture of turf debris, peatash and charcoal [439]. At the base of the cut, fragments of the base of a stave vessel had survived in situ but were very badly preserved and could not be retrieved. A turf layer occurred in the dog-leg ([1395]) around the barrel pit with a mixed floor layer above ([1253]). A TPQ from the turf layer returned a date of 1723. If this dog-legged niche is the inglenook, then it is likely the barrel pit is a later insertion. Indeed, just east of the centre of the room was another, but less identifiable feature; sealed by the floor layer was an irregular depression c. 20 cm deep and 20 cm in diameter [1381], filled with floor material/charcoal with peatash lenses and stones. Finds were not common, but included coal – the latter particularly unusual, and rare in Iceland for the 17th century. This is tentatively interpreted as the remains of a robbed out fireplace and could indicate the stoking pit for or robbed foundation of a stove – likely connected to the inglenook mentioned in the 1698 inventory. One fragment of stove tile was found in the collapse/abandonment layers infilling the room suggesting this would have been a tiled stove.  The 1698 inventory calls this building the Middle Living Quarters (Miðbaðstofa) and is very similar to the adjacent building (Structure XI). It was five bays long, with panelled walls and a wooden floor. Access was via a double door (presumably from the connecting corridor), one with lock and the other just a latch; inside it was divided into two rooms. In one was a round table and benches with two glass windows while in the other was a small four-poster bed with a table, bench, shelves and one window. There was a spiral staircase leading up to a loft which extended over the whole building and had three beds, a small table and a glass window in each gable. By 1722, the building has been renovated and is now six bays long; however no divisions are mentioned, its only internal furnishings being a bed, table and bench; it had three glass windows and one door with a lock. There is no mention of the loft which presumably is no longer present. Archaeologically, no divisions were discerned in the floors of this building but since the primary phase had wooden floor boards, these are unlikely to have left any trace.  Infilling the room were a series of turf collapse/dumping layers ([413], [422], [429], [1292]). They returned a TPQ of 1740.",Living Quarters,Miðbaðdstofa,

The side passage [106] also connected to another passage ([1269]; Structure XIV) running up to the cathedral. The corridor was perhaps the most impressive space in the farm complex for the extant height of its walls [1283], considerably higher than any other of the rooms - but this probably relates to the nature of its abandonment more than anything. Along the northern and central part of the east side, the upper courses of stones were missing at several points. Initially causing much confusion during excavation, the wall section adjacent to Structure XV (wheystore) had been completely robbed of its stones down to a depth of c. 1m. Much of these extant walls may relate to later repairs though.  Along most of its length, the corridor was only 1.2m wide, except at the southernmost end where it widened to c. 2 m. This difference probably relates to a later joining of the corridor with the passage between Structures XVIII and XIX; based on an interpretation of the inventories, the corridor probably originally stopped several metres north of these structures. At the southernmost end where the corridor bisects Structures XVIII and XIX, one can see on the northern face of the walls of Structures XVIII and XIX where the walls of the corridor have been brought inward presumably marking this conjunction. Just south of Structure XVIII, on the western wall of the corridor at floor level is a stone with carved inscriptions composed of a mixture of Roman and Runic characters. Although not fully legible, it appears to spell a name: HALLVARÐUR. Stylistically, it has been dated to c. 1700 and may have been part of a longer inscription – given that building stones would have been commonly re-used, this is not at all unlikely. It suggests this is possibly not its original location.  During excavation, it was considered that the walls of the main section of the corridor may have been narrowed at some point, but since the later walls would have probably been re-built from the same stone as the earlier line, it was decided not to excavate back, but trace as far as possible the line of a possible earlier wall near the base, either by visible exposure or probing. Probing traced out a possible stone line [1152], though this deviated only slightly from the later line of the corridor, indicating the eastern wall was set back at most by c. 20-25 cm, though this must remain still speculative. Regardless, it appears as if originally long sections of the corridor were largely free-standing with only some parts integrated with other structures (e.g. XV, XXII, XXX and XXXVI). At the northern end on the west side, the original outer face of the western wall was excavated ([1416/2003], showing the wall to be c. 1.4m thick. A TPQ of 1690 came from this wall which probably dates a repair. Given the nature of the remodelling of the corridor in the next phase, no clear floors were identified in this original phase except for some flags at the northern end [845].   Originally, it appears as if there was no connection between the corridor and the western side of the settlement, i.e. the Bishops wing; rather the connections lay to the east with the school. Only in the early 18th century do passages connecting the corridor to buildings on the west side appear (passages [1266], [1780] and [2553] with Structures IV, V and VIII respectively). These connections seem short-lived as by the late 18th century, they had all largely been closed off again.  An axial corridor appears to be mentioned from inventories as early as 1589 but it is difficult to know how far back a corridor existed in this location; the earliest source one can reliably match to the archaeological remains is the inventory from 1674 which describes a newly refurbished structure with an internal pinewood frame. The corridor is described in several places, following the order of the inventory but runs between a northern door (nordurdyr) and southern door, called the ‚Man‘s door‘ (kalldyr). A northern section from the north door is one bay long with a hinged door. The section which runs into the school area (passage [106]) is four bays long while the passage running in front the dormitory ([1269]) is two bays long; this meets the underpassage to the church which has two doors, one with a lock and the other with a latch. At the southern end of the main corridor, there is also a latched door. Based on the description and sequence of rooms it does not appear as if this corridor is connected to Structures XVIII and XIX at this time, as these structures are described in a very different place in the inventory. Archaeologically this makes sense as the corridor clearly kinks at the southern end to adjust to the alignment of these southernmost structures. All this suggests that originally, the corridor was only c. 18-19m long and exited just south of the wheystore (Structure XV).  In the 1698 inventory however, the sequence of rooms now implies the corridor extends all the way through to Structures XVIII and XIX increasing its length to 32m. The side passage [106] is now described as three bay long while the main part of the corridor to the south door is eleven bays and has been recently renovated. In 1722, the description changes only slightly; the northern section from the north door is now measured all the way to the entrance into the dining room (Structure V) and covers three bays; it is possible there was some kind of door frame marking this point, but no doors are recorded. Otherwise the details remain much the same. The description of the corridor in the inventories changes little in 1744 and 1747, except the northern section is now four bays long and the corridor increasingly shows signs of wear and needing repair.  Based on this information, one can tentatively suggest this phase subdivides into three:      • S13.1a: c. 1670-1690 – c. 19m long with passage 106 and 1269 coming off the eastern side     • S13.1b: c. 1690-1720 – c. 32m long as the corridor is now connected to structures XVIII and XIX at the south.      • S13.1c: c. 1720-1750 – c. 32m long with passages 1780 and 2553 added connecting the corridor to structures V and VIII. A drain was present by this point (if it did not previously exist).  Because there are no substantial deposits associated with these changes, mainly alterations to the walls, they have not been attributed to separate phases.",Main Corridor,Göng,t

TPQ from a clay pipe fragment suggested a date of c. 1680. In the passage [2326] the floor layer stops c. 0.4m from the north wall suggesting an installation here – e.g. inbuilt wooden cupboard or shelves. Turf levelling [2901] in the northwest corner of the building is probably associated with resetting some postpads ([2898], [2900]); it was sealed by a peatash dump ([2895]) probably deriving from the fireplace [2730]. Four more post pad depressions (east-west: [2882-5]; [2881]) along the northern edge of the room also mark the position of posts which were subsequently removed. The spacing between them varied from 1.5-1.8m supporting the documented description of seven bays . Fireplace [2730] continued in use as evidenced by an extensive peatash rakeout [2896] and in situ fuel residues [2875]. A turf levelling/repair patch [2878] lay beside the hearth. Just east of the fireplace was an area of flagstones, perhaps marking a standing area for a barrel or item of furniture. The fireplace [2951] in the eastern part of the building probably also remained in use, evidenced by secondary in situ fuel residues [2985]. The drain was re-modelled at the western end and possibly only confined to this short section, though it is also possible the main section also continued in use beneath the floors which sealed it. The re-built drain [2629] fed out of the room along the same route as the earlier drain; it consisted of side stones, mostly disturbed ([2630]/[2879]) except for ([2899]/[2905]) where they were protected by a later wall replacing the original gable end of the room. The drain had a series of fills ([2634], [2876], [2880]), which were also disturbed, especially at the eastern end. Sealing the drain was a turf dump [2873] and then a charcoal dump [2869], also sealed by later wall. As in the primary phase, dateable finds were almost absent; but some ceramics from the floor in this phase however returned a TPQ of c. 1650.",Meat Store,kjötskemma,t

Various patches of turf were deposited to level/repair the floor ([906], [973], [945], [984], [1021], [1036]), over which had accumulated another patchy charcoal/ash floor [879]. A TPQ from these floor returned a date of 1700. The channel [1017] was probably infilled in this phase by [1029] and covered by a flagstone surface [1018]. The fill was associated with a TPQ of 1725. The fireplace was still in use, and two further in situ ash layers ([1093], [1097]) were excavated.  The 1698 inventory describes the same building, mentioning that is was recently repaired during the encumbency of Bishop Þorláksson (1674-1697). The inglenook is mentioned as having a door. Strangely however in the inventory of 1722, no inglenook is mentioned – nor in any subsequent reports. It is possible it was maintained/owned at private expense and hence not listed, though this is still unusual as often this is stated. More likely, the inglenook no longer had a door and thus was no longer even regarded as a special room; given the lack of any value to its construction (essentially stone), it was not considered worth mentioning. The building in 1722 is otherwise the same but mentions additionally two loose tables and two wooden blackboards/writing boards. By 1744, the building is described as old and worn. The drawing from 1745/6 shows the school room divided into an upper class/grade (efribeckr) and lower (neðribeckr), located to the north and south respectively. It is likely this arrangement was also used in the 17th century.",School Room,skóli,t

It rather looks as if the passage was a stand-alone structure and not structurally connected to any of the aforementioned buildings, although the gap between it and the other buildings was minimal – c. 0.3m from Structure XXV at least. It might suggest the passage was a later addition linking formerly separate structures. The gaps in the turf and stone walls may of course have been bridged with timber. The passage was 5m long and only 0.9m wide internally, and often narrower; its walls [2657] were badly preserved in places due to later truncation but were c. 1.2m thick. Inside the passage there was a well-preserved  flagstone floor [2656]. Neither the walls nor the floor were excavated, only exposed and planned, but it is possible that a drain ran beneath the flagstone floor, based on the presence of a drain in Structure XXV. The passage was later sealed by levelling layers associated with the construction of later corridor (Structure VII).  The only corridor mentioned in the inventories of this period is in 1698 where a passage between the Bishops quarters and the Hall Stores (Gongen ur herbergiunum ad skalaskemmune) is briefly described, and has two doors, one with a lock. It implies that there was a clear demarcation between the north and south arms of the manor, and the lack of any mention of a corridor in 1674 may imply these sets of buildings were only later connected.",Corridor,Göng,

It appears to have been built on all sides with stone and earth/turf, its eastern wall shared with structures XI and XII and with which it seems to have been connected via passage [1608] (see Structure XI). The western end of the northern wall [2277] and western wall were fairly well preserved, but most of the southern and eastern wall seems to have been truncated – probably by later levelling. The inner face of the western wall may largely be a later rebuild (associated with phase S10.2) as there is a sharp break in the floor layer along the length of the western wall of c. 0.5m suggesting this wall lay further east in its original form. There was a break in the eastern wall which appears to have connected the kitchen to Structures XI and XII at the east, via passage [1608]. All of the eastern side of the northern wall is missing or disturbed which is probably due to later rebuilds and truncation; however, a floor layer with flagstones [2402] extended north into the line of the northern wall suggesting this wall may have been recessed with a projecting bay. This may mark the location of an inglenook fireplace mentioned in the inventory. North and east of this floor were a series of small stone and turf layers ([2269], [2280], [2290], [2350], [2371]) which could be the remnants of a wall around the inglenook. A TPQ of 1700 was associated with the lowest of these deposits. Where best preserved, the walls of structure X [2759] were made with stone facing and mixed turf/earth fill and c. 1.4m thick. The interior of the building itself was 8.9m long and 3.7m wide.   The interior of the building was surfaced with a trampled charcoal/ash floor [2235]. No close dating came from finds in the floor, only a general 18th century date. This floor was 40-50mm thick, but lensed with turf. The floor also sealed the drain coming out of passage [1608] associated with Structures XI and XII to the east. This drain was not investigated further so where it leads is uncertain but it seems likely it would have continued westward along the edge of the inglenook and exited though the entrance of the kitchen. Lower parts of the central arm of the later drain may therefore more properly belong to this phase ([2698], [2697], [2300], [2299], [2287]) although since this remain uncertain, they have been grouped with the next phase (see S10.2 below). There are no obvious indications of internal divisions and no internal features such as a fireplace, save the possible inglenook in the northeast corner; however, it is also possible any such features were removed during remodelling in the next phase.  This structure is the main kitchen (Elldhúsid) first mentioned in the 1722 inventory; an older kitchen was situated west of the meat store (see Structure XVII) and remained there as a second kitchen during the 18th century, but this was probably outside the excavation area. The 1722 inventory describes the main kitchen as somewhat worn which implies it was already some years old; a construction date in the first decade of the 18th century is therefore highly likely. The kitchen was five bays long. It had a main entrance porch with two doors, one with a lock the other with a latch. There was also a passage to an inglenook (önshús), typically a very small chamber with a fireplace and seating for a couple of people. It was one bay long and had a door with a latch.  The only likely place for this inglenook is in the northeast corner, marked by a break in the wall and an area of flagstones. If so, the passage must have been screened off by timber partitions east of the main entrance and parallel to the north wall, aligned with passage [1608].",Kitchen,Eldhús,t

There was a possible doorway in the north wall at the eastern end but at some point it was blocked in. Unfortunately, this was not further investigated, but the doorway would have led into the area behind Structures XI and XII which seems to have been an open space at this time. This area was later taken up by Structure VIII which was built c. 1720, suggesting that the doorway was probably blocked when Structure VIII was built. The interior space was now slightly longer at 11.9m long but of similar width, at 3.2m. The walls on the northern side [1703] survived to a height of four to five courses of stone, while on the south and western side [1697], only 2 courses survived. This phase is also marked by a distinct change in the floor layout. A substantial new flagstone floor [2067] was laid but only the two long sides of the building with a trampled ash path or central aisle along the centre line of the room. This configuration was maintained throughout all subsequent phases. The drain [2488] had probably gone out of use by this point. TPQ from clay pipes returned dates of 1700/1710; on the whole, the assemblage is likely to belong to the earlier part of the 18th century.  The 1698 inventory mentions the building was recently renovated during the encumbency of Þorláksson (1674-1697) and was now seven bays long, strong and in good shape. The lengthening of the structure in this phase would seem to relate to this renovation, suggesting the start date probably should be pushed back into the 1690s. It was probably at this time that the structure was also connected to the main corridor (Structure XIII).

Only the eastern 4.5m of this floor has survived, the rest having been truncated. In the southeast corner of the building, a tongue of floor material [183] extended 1.5m further south than the rest of the extant floor deposits; this could indicate an entrance or a small antechamber in this area [734] although the area has been so badly disturbed by the haybarn that it is difficult to be certain and this could simply be smearing from later disturbance.   The 1722 inventory records little change except the door has lost its lock and now only has a latch; the ceiling also appears to have flag stones (instead of timber panelling mentioned in many of the other buildings).  By 1744 the building was in very poor shape however and the beds may have lost their doors. The drawing from 1745/6 reveals little about the building, which is labelled the school hall (skólaskálin).

Arbitrary limits of excavation within the larger excavation area were imposed on the eastern, western and southern sides to enable some understanding of this structure within the time constraints. Only the south wall [2207] of the building was identified, associated with a TPQ of 1590; the northern and western walls probably lay beyond the reduced limits of excavation while at the east end it was clear the structure met corridor [2646] (Structure XXVI) and then continued on to join Structure XXIV, only the easternmost end of which was excavated . As of end of excavation then, it appears this was a building at least 9m long and c. 4.4m wide, but with a projection at the east end of c. 2m where a cellar was located . The south wall shows a possible threshold c. 1.7m wide about midway along.   The structure was excavated down to a turf levelling layer [2984] over which lay a trampled ash floor ([2658], [2610], [1997]) with substantial flagstones along the edges of the room and noticeably larger flags at the west end, where the floor also seemed to stop. There is almost certainly an earlier phase of floors beneath these. The excavated floor was quite substantial, but also somewhat disturbed. A TPQ of 1700 was associated with it from a clay pipe. It seems likely the western end marks a threshold, probably into another part of the same building (the Bishops chambers/Biskups kamers). A patch of floor [2997] was exposed to the west, but not fully investigated. It was associated with a TPQ of 1670. Some timbers ([2897], [2926], [2959]) survived lying over/within the ash floor at the northern side, aligned east-west; these may indicate the room had floorboards in a later phase; in the same floor, lay a large sill beam [2890].   The dominating feature of the room however was a deep, stone-lined cellar [2863]. There were clearly two phases of construction to this cellar, but only the later phase was excavated. In the primary phase, it was c. 3.2m by 2.5m, but at some point the north and east walls were re-built inward, making the cellar somewhat smaller (2.7m by 1.8m). The stone blocks used in the new walls were markedly smaller than in the original construction. In the last phase, the cellar extended c.1.5m deep from the floor surface; the base of the cellar had a compact, cobbled surface [3022] which is probably part of the original construction and was not excavated; over this, flagstones [2872] had been later laid and these may be contemporary with the re-build. Associated with these flagstones was a thick, black wet deposit with dense concentrations of animal bone, fish bone, egg shells, textiles, and artefacts. A TPQ of 1660 was associated with this layer.  The 1674 inventory describes a large building, twelve bays long which incorporates two main rooms, the Bishops living quarters (Biskupsstofan) and a Timber Room (Timburstofan) – the latter possibly all made from timber and lacking any turf and stone walls. The Bishops quarters has four beds and a door with a lock. Probably part of the same building are two associated rooms: an old store room (kiallarahusid gamla) with four beds, a small storage compartment (litli klefinn). To the north lay the bailiff or stewards quarters (radsmanshusid) which was not excavated or identified; it became a priests room in 1698 and was next to or opposite a nursery (barnahusid efra). Both of these rooms lay between the main north and south arms of the Bishop’s manor. In 1698, the building is much the same; the timbers are described as old but strong, though some rot can be seen. The description of the rooms gives more details though and now is clearly described as running from west to east and all of them have panelled walls. The westernmost room is the Timber Room, being three bays long and with a chamber in one corner. Inside it is furnished with two small tables, chairs and corner benches and there are two doors, both with lock and key. The Bishops quarters is also three bays long and furnished with two lockable doors, three four-poster beds, a small table and bench. The next room is called a bed room (sængurhus) and is presumably what was called the old store room in 1674; it was three bays long and furnished with four beds and a lockable door. The easternmost room and one presumably fronting the corridor, is a small, two-bayed room with one box bed, another bed, small table and bench and also has a lockable door. Adding the length of these rooms only gives a structure of eleven bays, so somewhere one bay has been lost.  Given the fragmentary nature of the archaeology, matching the remains to the inventory descriptions is extra difficult but if one assumes that the excavated remains constitute the easternmost end of the large, twelve bay building then the cellar and surrounding floor layers probably form part of the last room and the entrance vestibule (andyr). Although no mention is made of a cellar, it might not have been regarded as a room worthy of mention; certainly its presence would seem to support the idea that this area was for storage. Based on estimates of bay length, one would expect this building to have continued 2-5m beyond the limit of excavation, extending for a total length of c. 15-18m.  The building and whole area was levelled to make way for a new manor house (see Structure VI). In the cellar [2863], over the surface and accumulated debris, the upper part of the south wall of the cellar had collapsed in [2862], which in turn was sealed by carefully and deliberately laid turf [2727] infilling the whole of the cellar, although in the upper part of the deposit there was floor material mixed in. This was probably done during the construction of the new buildings, specifically Structure VI . A TPQ of 1700 was associated with this infill. Immediately above the floor in the main structure were walls and floor levelling layers associated with the construction of the new west wing. Along the north edge, some other layers ([2533], [2454], [2425], [2609]) represent levelling/disturbance of the floor/walls of this structure and/or construction associated with Structure VI as the wall of Structure VI are built over them.

The south end of this passage has been truncated by the construction of the later room Structure V, but it is likely the passage connected with another, unexcavated/unidentified structure to the south (presumably the nursery or barnahusid efra mentioned in the late 17th century inventories). The walls [597] of the passage were fairly well preserved and inside was a flagstone floor [2614] covering a drain [599] composed of sidestones [2616] and drain fill [2615]. A small patch of charcoal floor [2550] lay over the drain at the south end. The whole passage was infilled with turf [2322], seemingly at the same time as Structure XXV was levelled and it is thus likely this passage was in use during the lifetime of that structure. The lowest course of stones in the south wall of Structure XXV run across the entrance to the passage and were clearly laid prior to it. The only date associated with the passage was a TPQ of 1700 from the floor.  There is no mention of such a passage in either the 1674 or 1698 inventories and by 1722, both buildings had been levelled and built over. It is likely therefore that this passage was built after 1698, which agrees with the archaeological dating.",Passage,Göng,

The only indication of a new structure in this location is small fragment of wall [2561] which is curving and resembles the gable end of Structure XXV to the north. The possible internal line of the southern wall is marked by feature [1629] which was observed as a hollow/faultline under the floor of Structure V; its curve at the east end mirrors that of the wall fragment [2561].  Sealing the strip of ‚floor‘ layers described above were a series of turf debris layers ([1319]/[1314]/[1315]). Once again, the TPQ was c. 1700. This probably is associated with the abandonment of the original structure. At the eastern end of the putative structure was another area of probable demolition/construction debris [1904] associated with this re-building. Very little of this area was understood during excavation and the deposits were initially thought to be associated with some kind of smaller chamber attached to Structure V. The area was covered with lots of small stones with/over turf ([1953], [1956], [2011], [1937]). Based on their size and arrangement, they are unlikely to be a surface but more likely represent stone debris – possibly from roofing. A dump of peatash [1903]  lay above this. Sealing these layers were thick turf deposits ([1899], [1861]), associated with a TPQ of 1700.  The 1698 inventory mentions a room in the same location now called the Dining room (bordstofan). It remains six bays long but with wooden gables at each end and six glass windows; inside it was furnished with a high table and benches, as well as tapestries, a high seat and a smaller table, benches and two four-poster beds. It had two doors, one with a lock. At the front (west) end there was a small pantry (spise kamers) with latched double doors inside of which the walls were panelled and there were two bench tables. There was a loft above reached by encased stairs, which held five beds and a separate, smaller chamber with a small table and a lockable door. The building had been recently renovated by Bishop Þorláksson (1670-1697). Whether this represents a completely new structure or a renovation of the existing building is unclear, though archaeologically the implication is that a new structure may have been built.",Bishops Dining Room,Biskups borðstofa,

A TPQ of 1705 or 1722 (from a clay pipe) came from finds in this floor. The drain [2732] was probably still in use. Associated with this was the re-making of the flagged area in the southeast corner ([2788]/[2782]) 1.1m wide and 2.4m long and the addition of a matching platform in the northeast corner of the room [2789]/[2780]) 1.1m wide and 2.3m long. It is possible there was a partition here as suggested in the previous phase, separating this section off from the rest of the structure, but there is no clear evidence of a stone sill plate. Probably at the same time, the eastern wall was re-built [2848]; the original timber gable was taken down and a low turf and stone wall built over ([2843]). The new wall is rather insubstantial – only 0.7m wide, which suggests it may have just been a reconstructed foundation for a new timber gable on top of it.   The 1698 inventory mentions the building was repaired during the encumbency of Bishop Þorláksson (1674-1697); it is now only six bays long with six beds along the walls and one at the gable end. There remains a hinged door.  The abandonment of the room is marked by a series of turf dumps ([2573], [2341], [2420], [2568], [2403], [2359]) which probably respresents collapsed walls pushed into the room to level it off ready for Structure IV. A TPQ of 1700 was associated with these infill layers. The top of the drain had also been packed with turf filling ([2723/2724/2725]) which is probably the same material infilling the room. A TPQ of 1730/1740 came from this drain packing which is a little late. Accumulating or infilling the gap between the east wall of the structure and the outer wall of the axial corridor (Structure XIII) were a series of turf fills ([2844]/[2631]) – possibly deliberately dumped during the construction of Structure IV.",Male Servants Quarters,sveinaskáli,t

A turf sub-floor levelling layer ([1716], [899], [2197], [2198], [1387], [1442], [1896], [1892], [1846], [1844], [1842]), continued under the walls of the building, with substantial kerbstones projecting out beyond the walls at the western and eastern ends. Those at the eastern end were least clear, probably due to later disturbance from rebuilding. These kerbs probably helped to support gable ends. Just outside the eastern gable, in the narrow space [1916] c.0.7m wide between it and the western wall of the corridor (Structure XIII), lay a  flagged surface [1900] which seems to have covered a probable drain which was stone-lined [1905] and based [1988] and filled with [1906]. On the west side of the drain were remains of a turf surface ([1410], [1954]). A TPQ of 1680 was associated with the drain fill while a 1700 TPQ for the flagstones and turf surface.   Inside the structure a series of post pads (recorded with [832]) lay along the edge of the north and south walls, spaced 1-1.5m apart. Over the foundation layer had accumulated a thick, wood chip floor [1284] with some flagstones in places ([995], [904], [1442]). TPQ dates for the floor give 1719/1720 but 1730 for the sub-floor make-up. The centre of the floor had been truncated by the cutting of a drain, most of which was probably added in the next phase (see S 4.2). However, a short section at the east end was noticeably wider and with a kink where the remaining length of drain ran westward, suggesting two different phases of drain construction. The eastern end also curved and joined with the drain running in the passage [816], suggesting ths eastern section is the original/older part of a drain. The finds from the fills and sidestones offered no dating clues but since the whole drain was remodelled later on, such finds may not have been helpful anyway.  The structure seems to have been divided into three, possibly four smaller rooms, probably by wooden screens/panel walls resting on two stone sill plates: [994]/[808] and [905]/[807]. The eastern most room [797] was the largest, c. 3.8m long x 3.6m wide; the middle room [798] was slightly smaller at c. 3.6m x 3.6m but may have been divided into two smaller chambers c. 1.6m each; and the western room [799] was the smallest, c. 2.8 x 3.6m. This last room was probably separated from the central corridor (Structure VIII; see [1702]) by a wooden screen/panel wall resting on a substantial stone footing. There were no obvious features associated with any of these rooms except the middle one [798]. On the north side a large stone within [995] may mark a threshold for a door; opposite this and just offset from the southern wall was a square cobbled stone platform or plinth [934] that is could be the footings for a stove; a small deposit of ash [933] lay over the stone base but no remains from a stove. One stove tile fragment was found in this room, but from a later phase when the stove seems to have gone out of use and was probably dimantled (S4.3). Alternatively, the platform could mark the base for a staircase to the upper floor as recorded in the inventories; however the location of this staircase seems to have been in the easternmost room ([797]) and is most likely to have been positioned in a corner; the northeastern corner has a regular strip with no floor suggesting it might have been here.  Access between all three rooms and to a western corridor (Structure VII)  was through a series of centrally placed doors. Additionally,  there was also a passage [816] which connected this building (through the eastern room [797]) to rooms to the south (see Structure V). The passage floor was flagged ([1167]/[1170]) and appeared to have a short drain or sump [1285]. The drain connects with that in the main building, probably just a short section at the eastern end . A TPQ associated with the floor gives a date of 1740. This drain [1285] in passage [816] was somewhat unusual in that although there was a slight cut [1237] (which may have been erosion from running water), there were no side stones as with other drains on site but rather two laid timbers; but otherwise it had a typical fill ([1232]/[1185]) sealed by a later turf/earth layer [1191]. This drain also cut through the sub-floor levelling layer [1716] of the main room suggesting both the drain and the passage were more or less contemporary with the original construction of structure IV. The sides of the drain were built up with long, squared (boxed) timbers from pine [1175], packed behind with turf/earth [1229] and capped with flagstones [1170]. Sitting directly beneath the western timber was a coin minted in 1648. This may well be a foundation deposit since it is so fortuitous and while it provides a terminus post quem for the drain construction, and by association, the construction of the passage, the passage is likely still much later in date given the dating associated with structures IV and V. An alternative to this being a drain is that the long timbers could have acted as joists for a timber floor, which was later replaced with stone flags.   Strangely, this passage is not mentioned in any of the inventories and its only documented existence seems to be on the map from 1745/6. Its omission from the inventory could be due to various reasons; one is, simply the route the inventory-maker took did not necessitate using this passage, as access to both buildings (Structures IV and V) could be gained via the main corridor (Structure VII) – which is clearly the route taken in the inventory. It is also possible the passage was locked or concealed during the inventory. Finally it simply could have been built and blocked between the drawing in 1745/6 and and inventory of 1747 – though this seems unlikely. Whatever the explanation, its absence from several inventories is a little perplexing.  This structure is almost certainly the New Hall (Nýe Skálinn) described in the 1722 inventory and is described as being in a very good condition; the name suggests it was a fairly new building which fits the archaeological dates well. The building was six bays (stafgólf) long and divided into two rooms: an inner room which was furthest in and occuped two bays and an outer, larger room. The inner room had panelled walls and wooden floorboards, as well as a glass window and a door with a lock on it. Inside was  a table and two beds. The outer or front room had three glass windows and was occupied by seven beds; there was also a spiral staircase which led up to a loft room for the priest which extended just over the eastern end of the building for three bays and had one glass window. Inside was a bed and table. The inner room is probably room 797 while the outer, rooms 798 and 799; the partition between these may be a later addition. The 1744 inventory describes a newly built house replacing the New Hall, although it is more likely that the building was simply re-organized and renovated, chiefly at the western end. This seems to be supported by the unsual depiction on the 1745/6 map which shows the eastern and western ends as if they were two separate buildings (borðstofa and brytakamers), set apart in staggered formation; we found no evidence of this archaeologically and in fact this configuration is simply impossible based on the archaeological evidence. Moreover the passage shown connecting the brytakamers to the building at the south (Structure V) is clearly passage [816] which runs from the eastern room 797 of Structure IV. Their depiction in this manner probably indicates the re-building of the western end and that there was no connection between the two ends, at least when this drawing was made.  Overall, the structure remained six bays long and divided into two rooms: a front room of four bays (labelled as the borðstofa on the 1745/6 map), and a stewards room of one bay (labelled as the bretakamers on the same map). Strangely, the priest‘s room is described separately (but immediately after), as one bay long; this makes it seem that it is not part of the six-bayed building but it makes most sense to include it as it also makes up the total of 6 bays. Alternatively, the priest‘s room may have been in thre loft as described in 1722. Archaeologically there is evidence of a partition in the middle room (798), so possibly there were four spaces altogether: one large western room of three bays being the dining room (room 799); a middle space of two bays (798) divided into two smaller rooms one bay each with the eastern bay being the stewards room and the western bay connected to the dining room; and the easternmost room (797) of one bay, being either the priests room or part of the stewards rooms. The easternmost room still had panelled walls and timber floorboards, a lockable door and a glass window and was furnished with one bed, a table and bench and some bookshelves. There was also still a staircase here to the loft above which had a bed and a window. The adjacent stewards room had one bed and one glass window. Two windows are shown on the 1745/6 map, one each side of a passage connecting this to Structure V. Both the priests room and the stewards room are described as being old and therefore probably largely unaltered exept for a partition dividing the former rooms from those to the west. Both are also stated as needing repairs. The front room(s) which probably has been renovated remains four bays long in total. No beds are now listed here nor any furniture but given its label on the 1745/6 map and subsequent name in the 1747 inventory, this was about to be used as a dining room (borðstofa). On the other hand and most unusually for these inventories, a drain is mentioned running through the middle of the building, made from turf and stone. There is also a lockable door and three glass windows (two of which are shown on the 1745/6 map). The loft space which previously only covered three bays and formed the Priest‘s chambers, now seems to have been extended to cover the whole six bays; three bays probably remained part of the Priest‘s chambers as before, while the additional three bays are now occupied by two beds, a folding table and one glass window.  The 1747 inventory describes much the same details for the building as 1744 except now the first three bays of the front room are used as a dining room, being furnished with a table and three benches, two along the sides and one at the end of the table. The condition of the stewards and priest‘s rooms appear to have not been improved, despite the recommendations of the earlier inventory from 1744. By 1759, the dining room seems to have extended over five bays, the stewards room being removed with now only the priest‘s room (prestskamers) of one bay, at the far, eastern end remaining. This room seems to have been unaltered, retaining a locked door with a window, table, bench, bed and shelves. The staircase to the loft was still there which also had a locked door, one bed and one window extending over one bay. The rest of the loft was divided into two rooms – another small room with a bed and paneleld walls covering one bay, and a larger space of three bays with one window. The main part of the building downstairs which was a dining room (spistofa) had panelled walls, a wooden floor over two bays, a locked door and four windows; it was furnished with three large tables and benches. These inventories reveal quite a lot of internal re-arrangement of the space during a forty year period, with at least one major structural change to the west end. None of this is very visible archaeologically. The tripartite division for example seen archaeologically may have been a very late addition in this phase; the drain, which has been assigned to the next phase obviously was originally built in the 1740s and possibly at the same time as the floor levelling in this phase was put down. Indeed the floor levelling may represent the 1740s re-building as it extends beyond the western end of the walls into the corridor sealing some timber sill beams (Structure VII; see S7.1). If that is the case, almost all the archaeological remains of this building date to the 1740s-1760s, which means traces of the original 1720s building have been truncated.",New Hall/Dining Room & Chambers,skáli/borðstofa,t

The southern wall was 2.25m wide, the northern wall slightly thicker at 2.55m wide. The structure is to the south of [989] (Structure IV) and connected to it via passage [816]. The main walls are fairly well preserved; the northern wall ([1663]/[2548]/[2314]/[2051]) is shared with room [989] to the north while the southern wall [1662/2549] fronts onto a courtyard [1257]. The western wall would have just been a timber screen while the eastern wall was likely a timber gable on a stone sill plate, though nothing of this actually survived due to later re-modelling of this structure in the late 18th century (see S5.4).  The whole structure was built over a turf levelling layer ([2270] - unexcavated; also [1547], [1597], [1521]); a TPQ of 1700 is associated with this levelling layer. Post pads lay along the edges of the north and south walls, though the northern side had been more disturbed and some were missing/re-used in later phases. The primary floors are somewhat patchy and confined to the central section at the eastern end of the room, consisting of charcoal and flagstones ([1519], [1512]); it is possible the west end of the room had wooden floorboards as indicated by several fragments of wood within [2270] at the west end, all aligned on the long axis of the room. However, this is not stated in the inventory which generally did mention any timber floors and walls if they were present. No clear sign of a partition was found though based on the description, it is likely the area east of the passage [816] was a separate room.  A short passage [1780] c.08m wide and 3m long connected this building to the main axial corridor (St. XIII) at the eastern end; a flagstone floor [1795] covered a drain [1528] marked by sidestones [2010] and a fill [1799]. There was no clear cut for the drain, rather the side stones were simply set into a clayish turf construction layer which ran under all the walls. This drain would have run into the main drain of the axial corridor. It probably also extended into the main room as marked by a line of stones, but these have been disturbed, probably when the drain was dismantled and a new drain constructed in the centre of the room (see S5.3). Another, parallel channel [1629] to the south was originally also interpreted as a drain but it now seems likely that this channel was simply marking the edge of an earlier wall line which had been filled and/or subject to movement causing a linear depression in the floor of structure V which mimicked the appearance of a drain (see structure XXXI, S31.2). The north ([2536]/[2052]) and south [1678/1774] flanking walls of the passage were only one course of stones high, due to the truncation to this area by later alterations (see S5.4). At the east end of the passage where it entered into the main axial corridor (Structure XIII), there were traces of an earlier floor surface [2039] associated with the original, wider phase of the corridor.  A TPQ of 1690 came from both the drain fill and this latter floor surface. This passage would seem to be a later addition as its north wall appears to abut an original eastern face of the northern wall; also the walls are clearly flanking the passage and do not seem to have effected the eastern gable wall of the structure which would have still been standing. The 1722 inventory describes this building as a dining room (bordstofan) of eight bays (stafgólf) long with panelled walls and ceiling; a hinged door with a ring latch lies at the entry into the corridor while at the other (eastern) end, there is a small pantry (spisskamers) with a lockable door. Inside the pantry which was two bays long, was a table and shelves. Inside the main room was a long table with benches around it and a smaller bench at one end. There were also three windows with circular panes in this room. There was also a loft space upstairs accessible via a spiral staircase; the loft was divided into two rooms: a small panelled room three bays long with a bed, table and window; and a larger room (presumably five bays) with four beds and two more glass windows. The whole building is described as strong and well-built and was probably recently constructed. The passage to the main corridor (Structure XIII) is also briefly described, as one bay long. Given that this passage seems to be a later addition, it suggests that the start date for this structure could be pushed back a little earlier to c. 1710; the 1698 inventory mentions a dining room probably in the same location but only six bays long, it is likely this structure was pulled down and Structure V replaced it sometime in the first decade or two of the 18th century.",Bishops Dining Room,Biskups borðstofa,t

It is very poorly preserved, especially towards the western end. A southern wall of stone-facing and earth/turf infill was built in two segments, each c. 4.5m long and c. 2.6m thick ([1259], [2534], [2386], [2387], [1943]) with a wide gap of c. 2.3m in between marking a small chamber.  Most of this western section of the south wall had also been truncated, probably in relation to later re-building. The eastern end of the structure probably had a timber screen and doorway for access into the corridor (Structure VII) while the western end probably had a timber gable, which was marked by a clear stone sill base [2564]. The whole structure measured c. 11m long and 4.4m wide, internally.   A sub-floor turf levelling layer [2566] lay within the interior of the whole building, but remained unexcavated. Some post pads contemporary with the structure remained in situ, mostly along the northern side. Over the unexcavated levelling layer was a patchy floor which was best preserved at the eastern end, while a probable timber partition dividing the room in two is marked by a stone sill base [1917]. The eastern room [949] was c.6m long with a stone flag surface [1623] in situ in the northeast corner, sealed by mixed turf and ash floor ([1617]/[2054]). This area may have been partitioned off into a small chamber. A TPQ from this floor gave a date of 1720/1730. A charcoal-rich floor [1359] was recorded extending over both rooms, but was thicker at the west end; it also included the stone sill partition within it. Several fragments of timber and many smaller wood chips/splinters lay over the floor in the eastern room which may indicate floor boards had been used (but subsequently removed), explaining the patchiness of the floor layers. The western room [972] at c. 5.5m long had thicker floor patches surviving in the centre and southern side ([1359]/ [2281]).  A partition may have divided this room into two smaller spaces. Against the southern wall was a distinctly more compact and burnt area [2301] which probably marks the location of a stove. The 1722 inventory mentions a ceramic stove recently removed, which is probably what this area relates to.   A series of floors also lay in the opening of the southern wall; these probably mark a small chamber [2214] which would have had a wooden gable on its southern side. The room was only c.2.1m wide and 2.5m deep. The floors consisted of a stone cobbled surface [2347]/[2511] covered by charcoal dumps [2494/2335] and mixed turf [2324] and ash [2310], the ash of which probably came from an iron stove which the 1744 inventory mentions. The stove probably lay in the northwest corner of this small room; all this area was very badly disturbed, the floor layers being smeared/mixed with the wall due to later disturbance. It is also likely there was a chimney in this location. The dating from these floors was very broad, but within the 18th century. A bowed kerb [2040] and paved area [1966] lay outside/to the south of the building over which lay a dump of peatash (see Courtyard).  Somewhat breaking the pattern, the description of this structure always comes at the end of the inventories, rather than en route so to speak. The 1722 inventory describes this building as eight bays (stafgólf) long with ten glass windows, panelled walls all around and timber floors; there are also two panelled chambers, possibly at the western end, each with a lockable door. At the other end of the building are double doors. There is a spiral staircase up to a loft room which has four glass windows, a lockable door and three built-in beds. A ceramic stove with copper knob handles is mentioned as having been taken away – presumably to be replaced by an iron stove which appears in the next inventory. The 1744 inventory describes much the same building except in more detail. The building seems to be divided into two main rooms, with the inner (western) room sub-divided into two smaller chambers. The division between the inner and outer rooms is marked at the fifth bay by a panelled wall with a double-locked door in a carved door frame. The inner room has eight glass windows. The inner room has benches and a long table at the gable end and a bookcase with six shelves at the other by the door which is not locked. One of the chambers is described as a store room (kjallari) and is lockable. In the front (eastern) room, there were four glass windows and benches beneath the windows on one side; there was also a door on hinges, with a lock and a copper ring handle with silver inlay. The loft upstairs was split into two rooms with three beds and a small glass window in the front part and three glass windows in the inner room. Projecting from the south side of the building is another chamber, which is described as newly re-built and in good condition; it was constructed from double timber walls, had three glass windows with shutters and inside had two book cases and an iron stove (vindofn) with a copper pipe/chimney. A large flat tile lay on the back of the oven instead of stone facing on the wall. The chamber had a panelled door with a lock and key and iron reinforcement straps. The chamber also had a loft above with two beds, one glass window and a door with a lock. The 1745/6 drawing shows the building called the Bishops Living Quarters (Biskups Baðstofa) with the projecting chambers on the south side (Biskups kamers) with a  chimney on its eastern side and front room is marked (fremre stofan). Square windows are shown both on the ground floor and loft. The location of the chimney on thid drawing would seem to be misplaced,  as based on the archaeological evidence the western side of the chamber would be more plausible. The 1747 inventory does not show much change except the eastern room now has two windows instead of four. There is also mention of a newly made timber kitchen with a chimney which goes with the projecting southern chamber; although it is not clear exactly where this is located, since there is no mention of the stove and chimney described in the 1744 inventory, it may have been in the same place as that. The 1759 inventory reads the same, but now mentions that the chamber projecting from the south side is two and half bays (stafgólf) long. This could refer to the extension seen in the next phase. On the whole, the building is described as being in bad condition with rotten timber. On the whole, the archaeological remains seem to match these descriptions; the partition seen dividing the structure into two halves is probably the division into two rooms; no subdivisions at the western were seen but this was the most disturbed. The chamber projecting on the south side is also extant, and although badly disturbed, there was clear evidence of a stove having been here.",Bishops Living Quarters,Biskups baðstofa,t

Most of it is encompassed within the excavation area except a portion to the north; here, the corridor clearly continues beyond the limit of excavation where a flagstone (or drain capstone) is still visible under the grass and can be traced up to the stone-lined verge of the present day car park. The length within the excavation area was 13.5m, and internally it was c. 2.m wide though this varied depending on the location of the timber screens separating the corridor from the various structures. Where the foundations for structure IV projected out, the corridor had a distinct kink or dog-leg – though this may have been a later modification. It had four structures coming off it, two to the east and two to the west (Structures III-VI). Based on the inventory descriptions, there were probably doors or at least partitions segmenting the corridor into three sections, which was reduced to two by the 1740s.  The surface of the corridor was laid with turf and flagstones ([2491], [2481], [2478], [2490], [2137], [2438], [2436], [2427], [2426], [1498]); TPQ from these deposits gave a date of 1730/1740. Over the floor lay four substantial wooden sill beams [1676], which rested along the edge of the walls, the two at the southern end with rectangular sockets for holding timber uprights, possibly indicating the presence of stave panelling at this end of the corridor (see the wood chapter in a later volume for more details). The north east sill beam was sealed by the sub-floor construction layer [1716] for Structure IV, suggesting these beams were laid prior to this layer – or at least the western end of it, which juts out into the corridor by c.1m (see Structure IV, S4.1 for further discussion). Several early 19th century whiteware sherds were recovered when these sill beams were excavated which must be intrusive from overlying/later deposits; given that these beams remained in situ and probably in use well into later phases, such contamination is not unlikely. Over the surface of the corridor lay an accumulation of ash and woodchips with some flagstones ([1461], [1627], [1679], [2102], [2450]) and which contained a large number of finds with a TPQ of 1720.  This corridor is not described in a single place in the inventories but rather mentioned in two to three different places. The main description occurs under the label of the vestibule or entrance hall (Herbergia Anndyr) which is the main door on the south side; this is followed later (in 1722) by a description of the corridor (göng) between the Bishops Living Quarters (Structure VI) and the New Hall (Structure IV); and finally as the area between the latter and the Store room (Structure III). In the 1722 inventory the vestibule is described as one bay long with panelled walls and a hinged and lockable door; above it was a loft with a table and a glass window and three beds (which presumably extended north over the corridor).  An encased stairway lead up to the loft which has a lockable door. Going through the vestibule into the corridor between the northern and southern buildings, no special walls or floor are mentioned. Finally the section of corridor between the two northern buildings has panelled walls, and also described as one bay long. It is possible that the roof ridge lines of the corridor ran east-west where it was within the space between buildings though this is purely conjectural.   The 1744 inventory suggests a change to this layout and describes the vestibule as newly re-built. Now the vestibule includes the whole way to the northern pair of buildings and is more than five bays long – which means its roof line has shifted to the north-south axis. It is panelled in the first bay with a bench and above it, a loft extending the for five bays; the loft room contains a table, three beds and two glass windows. Enclosed stairs lead up to the loft which has a lockable door. The front door now just has a latch. The 1747 and 1759 inventories record the same, although in the latter there is only one window in the loft now. The northern section of the corridor seems unchanged, its roof-line still running east-west; it remains the same and is described as being in good condition in the 1744, 1747 and 1759 inventories. The drawing from 1745/6 shows this new configuration with a north-south alignment for the southern end of the corridor and an east-west one for the northern part. It is unlikely any doors separated these different sections of the corridor as none are mentioned.",Vestibule & Corridor,göng,t

The walls ([2047]/[1438]/[2323]) were very badly preserved, but nonetheless more or less extant around three of the four sides. The eastern wall was very narrow at 0.97m wide though the western wall which it probabaly shared with Structure XI was more substantial, at 3.1m wide. At the southern end it is unclear if there was a turf wall or only a wooden gable end; the foundation layer appears to extend beneath a row of stones suggesting this row may be the sill plate for a wooden gable. Further flat stones interpreted as post pads at this end [1439] lend more support to the presence of a gable. On the east side of the building in the middle of the wall was an entrance passage [2553] which led, via a set of stone steps, into the main axial corridor (Structure XI). The passage was 0.8m wide and 1m long and descended down by c. 0.9m. The surface of the room was covered in turf and flagstones [2753]/[2546], over which had accumulated a trampled charcoal and ash floor [2453]/[2545]. TPQ from this floor gave a date of c. 1720/1730. At the south end, the floor was almost all truncated due to later remodelling, either of the south wall in the next phase or the construction of a timber floor, as indicated in the 1744 inventory. An area of flagstones and brick [2448] lay against the west wall opposite the entrance, which could be remains of a stove base – a fragment of stove tile was found in the wall re-build of the next phase).   This structure is the nursery (barnhús) mentioned in the 1722 inventory and is recorded as having been built during the encumbency of Bishop Vídalín (1698-1720). It is probably a fairly new structure at the time of the 1722 inventory. An earlier mention of two nurseries occurs in the 1698 inventory which is when Vídalín arrived in the position, but this structure is unlikely to be either of those. In 1698, the upper one (barnahusid efra) seems to have been located in an area between the Bishop’s living quarters and the Boys Hall, i.e. Structures XXIII and XXV and has not been investigated or identified. The lower one (barnahusid nedra) lay off the main axial corridor, but probably north of the wheystore (Structure XV) if the order of descriptions in the inventory can be trusted to infer such; if so it was also not identified during excavation but should be located just north of the wheystore on the same side of the corridor. The current structure (i.e VIII) was probably built c. 1720 at the end of Vídalín’s encumbency and in the 1722 inventory it is listed after the wheystore, suggesting it is to the south of it. Indeed, the 1745/6 drawing clearly depicts the nursery (barnhús) here. The 1722 inventory describes a building four bays long with five beds; there was a loft above half the building with two more beds. The door into the room had hinges and a lock.   The 1744 inventory describes the same building but mentions the ground floor now has a small chamber one bay long at each end, both with panelled walls and a bed; one side of the house also had a raised timber floor.  There was also only one bed in the loft. It is described as being in good condition. Little has changed by 1747 except there are only four beds in the main room downstairs now, not five; the roof is said to have old timber and by 1759, it seems the loft only extended over one bay length. The name barnhus is somewhat unusual and it is not fully clear who may have lived here; however the presumption is that it was used as the quarters for children or foster children in the Bishops household.

Over these was a patchy but extensive charcoal floor [1286] which also covered the whole room. Internal divisions are difficult to discern in this phase but based on the inventory, there does seem to have been two separate chambers now; possibly both are located at the eastern end, each one bay wide. There is a suggestion of a similar arrangement in the next phase (see S11.3). Associated with these floors were a set of postpads [1268/1481] arranged around the edges of the room; there probably had been 6 pairs of posts spanning the width of the room, spaced between 1.8 and 1.2m apart; all 6 postpads survived in situ along the north wall, but only 5 on the south. At the two ends of the room, 2 further posts had probably stood; at the east end, both pads survived but at the west, only one. The floors were also very ‘clean’ of finds, unlike almost every other room on the site; the TPQ from the floors returned a date of c. 1650.   Covering part of the original flagstone floor in the passage [421] was a charcoal layer [1169] which was contemporary with the floor [1286] in room [691]. TPQ from the floor returned a date of c. 1650. A similar charcoal floor [1612] lay over the flagstones in passage [1608]. This floor returned a TPQ of c. 1700.  The 1722 inventory now calls this building the Priest‘s Living Quarters (Prestbaðstofan), and now seems to have two chambers on the ground floor, each with a lockable door, a bed, table and glass window, while the loft above extends over four of the five bays. There now appears to be also a door into the building with a lock, presumably on the passage side rather than an external door. The main corridor connecting this with the other living quarters to the south (Structure XII) is now only two bays long.

The inbuilt feature in passage [2326] was removed  resulting in more space being freed up in the passage itself, now 1.2m wide. From this phase on, the floor extended closer or right up against the north wall as it had in the first phase.   A substantial, thick turf levelling layer was deposited across most of the room and into the passage ([2777/2696], [2594]); several more discrete deposits of turf deposits lay in the northwest corner ([2681], [2620], [2604]). Over the levelling were some flagstones at the west end [2602] associated with patches of floor material ([2613], [2591], [2586], [2584]) both of which sealed a large depression/hollow [2624] in front of a new fireplace in the western room; this hollow probably represents truncation caused in the dismantling of the old fireplace.  The roof must have also been repaired at this time as the timber posts would have been re-set when the floor was re-surfaced. The drain was certainly defunct at this stage.  The flagstones in the western part were contemporary with a more extensive series of floors in the eastern half of the room ([2589], [2574], [2391], [2372]), which extended into the passage [2326] as floor [2569/2571] – although there were clear signs of a change in composition and it seems likely there was a wooden threshold and door marking the transition into this passage. Covering the floor in the passage was a peatash dump [2345]. A TPQ from this peatash returned a date of 1719. The dating from these floor layers all suggests a late 17th/early 18th century date with a TPQ of 1680 from the ceramics and c. 1700 from clay pipes. Cut through the uppermost floor was a posthole [2532], whose function is rather enigmatic but could mark the position of a post added to support a weakness in the roof.  Both the fireplaces from the previous phase were re-built. The new fireplaces in this room were in very similar locations to the earlier ones; the western fireplace [2597] was built just to the west of its precursor [2730] and was possibly much smaller; very little of this fireplace survives as it was demolished during the construction of yet another fireplace in the last phase of the room. The hollow [2624/2647] created by dismantling of the earlier fireplace was levelled with turf [2636], with a cut [2595] (1.1x0.9m, 0.15m deep) made for the new fireplace. No in situ stones survived, only remnant peatash deposits ([2570], [2575], [2628], [2627], [2590]) within this cut as well as a rake-out deposit [2633]. The northeastern fireplace [3032] was also disturbed but better preserved; it was located more or less over the earlier one [2626]. It consisted of stone blocks ([2232], [2592]), surviving on two sides with its west side robbed but demarcating a space 0.8 long and 0.4m wide. Several extensive peatash layers ([2224], [2289], [2298], [2588], [2596], [2599], [2601]) abutted the fireplace but some had been badly disturbed by later activity. Another probably represents (disturbed) rake-out [2485]. This fireplace was probably associated with a wooden chimney, based on the 1745/6 plan.  This phase probably can be tied to the inventory from 1722, which describes the building as eight bays and in good condition indicating a recent repair. Already by 1744 however, it is described as being worn and again in 1747. The only change is that two doors (both with latches) are mentioned in 1744. The drawing from 1745/6 shows the meat store – but is labelled strangely as the tapestry store (Reflaskemma) with a door at the western end and a chimney at the east end. There is no sign of any building called the Old Kitchen (Edlhúsid Gamla), which according to the inventories remained in use until the 1760s, though there is a building called the harðatorfs kofi (i.e. ‘hard turf’ shed) on this plan. The passage between this building and the adjacent store (Structure XVIII) is also marked as viewing platform (Siónpláts) and a theatre (Theatrum) on this drawing, but there is no mention of this in the inventories either and given the size of the passage, these labels probably refer to an improvised usage of the external walls and roof of the passage – that is, an open air auditorium. No windows are shown on the building.",Meat Store,kjötskemma,t
43,S23.2,1720,1720,,"The full extent of this building was not recovered due to lack of time and severe truncation and disturbance from later construction. Arbitrary limits of excavation within the larger excavation area were imposed on the eastern, western and southern sides to enable some understanding of this structure within the time constraints. Only the south wall [2207] of the building was identified, associated with a TPQ of 1590; the northern and western walls probably lay beyond the reduced limits of excavation while at the east end it was clear the structure met corridor [2646] (Structure XXVI) and then continued on to join Structure XXIV, only the easternmost end of which was excavated . As of end of excavation then, it appears this was a building at least 9m long and c. 4.4m wide, but with a projection at the east end of c. 2m where a cellar was located . The south wall shows a possible threshold c. 1.7m wide about midway along.   The structure was excavated down to a turf levelling layer [2984] over which lay a trampled ash floor ([2658], [2610], [1997]) with substantial flagstones along the edges of the room and noticeably larger flags at the west end, where the floor also seemed to stop. There is almost certainly an earlier phase of floors beneath these. The excavated floor was quite substantial, but also somewhat disturbed. A TPQ of 1700 was associated with it from a clay pipe. It seems likely the western end marks a threshold, probably into another part of the same building (the Bishops chambers/Biskups kamers). A patch of floor [2997] was exposed to the west, but not fully investigated. It was associated with a TPQ of 1670. Some timbers ([2897], [2926], [2959]) survived lying over/within the ash floor at the northern side, aligned east-west; these may indicate the room had floorboards in a later phase; in the same floor, lay a large sill beam [2890].   The dominating feature of the room however was a deep, stone-lined cellar [2863]. There were clearly two phases of construction to this cellar, but only the later phase was excavated. In the primary phase, it was c. 3.2m by 2.5m, but at some point the north and east walls were re-built inward, making the cellar somewhat smaller (2.7m by 1.8m). The stone blocks used in the new walls were markedly smaller than in the original construction. In the last phase, the cellar extended c.1.5m deep from the floor surface; the base of the cellar had a compact, cobbled surface [3022] which is probably part of the original construction and was not excavated; over this, flagstones [2872] had been later laid and these may be contemporary with the re-build. Associated with these flagstones was a thick, black wet deposit with dense concentrations of animal bone, fish bone, egg shells, textiles, and artefacts. A TPQ of 1660 was associated with this layer.  The 1674 inventory describes a large building, twelve bays long which incorporates two main rooms, the Bishops living quarters (Biskupsstofan) and a Timber Room (Timburstofan) – the latter possibly all made from timber and lacking any turf and stone walls. The Bishops quarters has four beds and a door with a lock. Probably part of the same building are two associated rooms: an old store room (kiallarahusid gamla) with four beds, a small storage compartment (litli klefinn). To the north lay the bailiff or stewards quarters (radsmanshusid) which was not excavated or identified; it became a priests room in 1698 and was next to or opposite a nursery (barnahusid efra). Both of these rooms lay between the main north and south arms of the Bishop’s manor. In 1698, the building is much the same; the timbers are described as old but strong, though some rot can be seen. The description of the rooms gives more details though and now is clearly described as running from west to east and all of them have panelled walls. The westernmost room is the Timber Room, being three bays long and with a chamber in one corner. Inside it is furnished with two small tables, chairs and corner benches and there are two doors, both with lock and key. The Bishops quarters is also three bays long and furnished with two lockable doors, three four-poster beds, a small table and bench. The next room is called a bed room (sængurhus) and is presumably what was called the old store room in 1674; it was three bays long and furnished with four beds and a lockable door. The easternmost room and one presumably fronting the corridor, is a small, two-bayed room with one box bed, another bed, small table and bench and also has a lockable door. Adding the length of these rooms only gives a structure of eleven bays, so somewhere one bay has been lost.  Given the fragmentary nature of the archaeology, matching the remains to the inventory descriptions is extra difficult but if one assumes that the excavated remains constitute the easternmost end of the large, twelve bay building then the cellar and surrounding floor layers probably form part of the last room and the entrance vestibule (andyr). Although no mention is made of a cellar, it might not have been regarded as a room worthy of mention; certainly its presence would seem to support the idea that this area was for storage. Based on estimates of bay length, one would expect this building to have continued 2-5m beyond the limit of excavation, extending for a total length of c. 15-18m.  The building and whole area was levelled to make way for a new manor house (see Structure VI). In the cellar [2863], over the surface and accumulated debris, the upper part of the south wall of the cellar had collapsed in [2862], which in turn was sealed by carefully and deliberately laid turf [2727] infilling the whole of the cellar, although in the upper part of the deposit there was floor material mixed in. This was probably done during the construction of the new buildings, specifically Structure VI . A TPQ of 1700 was associated with this infill. Immediately above the floor in the main structure were walls and floor levelling layers associated with the construction of the new west wing. Along the north edge, some other layers ([2533], [2454], [2425], [2609]) represent levelling/disturbance of the floor/walls of this structure and/or construction associated with Structure VI as the wall of Structure VI are built over them. A TPQ of 1674/1700 was associated with these.",Bishops Living Quarters,Biskupsbaðstofa,
44,S25.3,1720,1720,,"In the next phase the floor was resurfaced with more flags and ash [2521]. A TPQ of 1705 or 1722 (from a clay pipe) came from finds in this floor. The drain [2732] was probably still in use. Associated with this was the re-making of the flagged area in the southeast corner ([2788]/[2782]) 1.1m wide and 2.4m long and the addition of a matching platform in the northeast corner of the room [2789]/[2780]) 1.1m wide and 2.3m long. It is possible there was a partition here as suggested in the previous phase, separating this section off from the rest of the structure, but there is no clear evidence of a stone sill plate. Probably at the same time, the eastern wall was re-built [2848]; the original timber gable was taken down and a low turf and stone wall built over ([2843]). The new wall is rather insubstantial – only 0.7m wide, which suggests it may have just been a reconstructed foundation for a new timber gable on top of it.   The 1698 inventory mentions the building was repaired during the encumbency of Bishop Þorláksson (1674-1697); it is now only six bays long with six beds along the walls and one at the gable end. There remains a hinged door.  The abandonment of the room is marked by a series of turf dumps ([2573], [2341], [2420], [2568], [2403], [2359]) which probably respresents collapsed walls pushed into the room to level it off ready for Structure IV. A TPQ of 1700 was associated with these infill layers. The top of the drain had also been packed with turf filling ([2723/2724/2725]) which is probably the same material infilling the room. A TPQ of 1730/1740 came from this drain packing which is a little late. Accumulating or infilling the gap between the east wall of the structure and the outer wall of the axial corridor (Structure XIII) were a series of turf fills ([2844]/[2631]) – possibly deliberately dumped during the construction of Structure IV.

It is likely this is a consequence of greater mixing/disturbance at the south end. Indeed, beneath this surface at the southwestern corner were a series of sandy dumps ([2267], [2276], [2279]) associated with a TPQ of 1820; these lay over a flagged surface ([2285], [2315], and [2622]) running in front of Structure X and associated with a TPQ of 1790. A secondary layer of flags lay over this ([2004], [1989], [1919], [1923]) with a TPQ of c. 1800; both surfaces probably represent a proper pavement in front of Structure X. To the east, further patchy yard deposits also occurred ([2612], [2572]; [1638], [1646]).  Other possible remants of an earlier paved surface in front of Structure IV include a series of flagstone deposits ([1966]: [2585], [2587], [2593], [2598], [2205], [1877]), set within a curved kerb [2040]. A large dump of peatash [1863] lay over this pavement and up against the south wall of Structure IV, just to the left of a central door, associated with a TPQ of 1700. Probably contemporary with these flagstones and kerb (and the construction of the new west wing), was some paving [1699] just at the entrance into the corridor (Structure VII), which lay over some turf levelling/debris ([2373], [2374]). The paving was associated with a TPQ of 1700 and the underlying turf debris, a date of 1691. Somewhat later is another area of paving [490] which lay south of Structure V outside and to the west of the centrally placed doorway (see S5.4). This probably dates to c. 1780.

An area [1684] composed of multiple lenses of turf and stone flags ran east and alongside this wall which probably represents demolition debris/levelling from the previous phase; a TPQ of c.1710 is associated with this surface. A small ash dump/lens [1248] was also associated with this area. A TPQ of 1710 was associated with this ash dump. It is likely that the western wall may have also been set back a little at the same time by 0.5m (see S10.1) while the northern wall was completely re-built [2111] but with a centrally-placed entrance as before c. 0.9m wide. Only the southern wall appears unmodified.  In addition to the re-building, there was also the closing of the earlier drain that had fed out of Structures XI and XII to the east and new drain built. The new drain was asymmetrical and T-shaped [1773]/[1281], with two arms on each side of the room, feeding into a central drain, which ran out through the main door and joined drain [1077]  in the courtyard. The drain appears to have been constructed at the same time as the sub-floor levelling/construction layer and consisted of side stones, capstones and upper and lower drain fills, separately defined and excavated in each of the three segments. Because the central section of the drain was later re-cut and extended in the later phase of the room (see [1101]), no capstones survived here and indeed most of the primary fill seems to have been truncated. The central drain appears to have a primary cut [2698] associated with it which may actually be the remnant of the original drain from the previous phase (see S10.1 above). The dating from this drain was equally broad, except for one TPQ of 1730/1740 associated with the side stones of the central drain.   Associated with the installation of the drain was a re-surfacing of the floor. A turf levelling layer [2191/2192] formed the primary floor surface; it was generally clean except for some scattered flagstones at the western end, up against the wall. Over this had been deposited/accumulated an extensive charcoal and ash floor [1704] which was excavated on a 1m grid. The floor varied in thickness, usually c. 40-50mm but sometimes as much as 100-120mm thick, especially in the centre of the room where the layers were most compacted and trampled. No close dating came from any of the floor layers except for a broadly 18th century date. With the dismantling of the inglenook, the lack of clear fireplace is surprising if this was indeed a kitchen; possibly one existed but was subsequently dismantled. A likely position is centrally against the southern wall where there is a clear and regular, rectangular-shaped void in the floor layer 1.8m long and 0.5m deep.  The 1744 inventory records the kitchen as only four bays long now and there is no mention of the inglenook; instead there is a chimney at one end (associated with a fireplace – perhaps of brick) and a half gable at the other. The void in the floor mentioned above is possibly where the firerplace and chimney was located and may mark its removal although both the inventory and the map show a chimney at the eastern end of the room. There is also only one door now, but with a lock. The 1747 inventory is the same as the one from 1744, as is the one from 1759 although by this time the walls were in poor condition (though the timber was still sound). The kitchen is now referred to as the New Kitchen (Elldhusid nya).

The northern, outer face of the wall ([1432]/[1433], [1429]) was rebuilt and associated with a TPQ of 1700 – but from an upper, disturbed section. The passage/doorway [1295] in the northern wall was 0.9m wide and 1.5m long. Associated with this modification was a mixed deposit containing red and white clay [1345] similar to that used in the wheystore (see Structure XV). The deposit – along which possibly disturbed floor layers ([2328]/[2325]) - lay under the new walls ([1305]/[1341]) of the passage [1295]. It is unclear what this clay deposit is doing in the room but it seems to be confined only to the construction of the passage. The surface of the new entrance was covered by a charcoal floor deposit [1339] and over that, stone flags [1294] which had been placed over a turf levelling layer ([1310]/[1297]). This was contemporary with a re-surfacing of the interior of the building which now seems to be divided into two equally sized halves based on differentiation in floor material. There was localized turf levelling layers ([1210], [1256]) and a flagstone surface ([276], [302], [322]) in the eastern room [2757] of the building, which also may have had a sub-division with a narrow space 1.4m wide at the far easternmost end. The TPQ from this flagged floor returned a date of 1730/1740. No sign of any new floors were identified on the western side, save for some very localized turf deposits against the western and southern wall ([1230], [1262]) which probably represent repairs to the postpads (and thus roof-bearing posts). In addition, a small, discrete dump of peatash [480] lay in the southwest corner of the building. However, a localized spread of red and white clay [1182] similar to that under the walls of the passage [1295], extended over the western room and central aisle, north of the drain and sump. A clay pipe fragment from the deposit returned a TPQ of 1630. As with the clay deposit in the passage, it is unclear what this represents but it may simply be redposited material incorporated into a turf levelling layer. The flagstones here may have been robbed – or this room had floorboards.  It is appears that the western passage [1608] was closed off at this time; the outer face of the western wall [1619] of the passage and the common wall for Structures XI and XII, has stones which run across the entrance of passage [1608]. If so, it suggests that the only entry to Structures XI and XII at this time was at the north side of Structure XI and may even explain why this door was inserted. This change also relates to changes in adjacent structures. To the west, the eastern wall of the kitchen (Structure X) was re-built with its western gable only c. 0.7m from the original entrance in passage [1608].   No inventory exists for this period so we possess no other source to confirm this possible alteration.  The abandonment of the building is broadly contemporary with the construction of Structure IX . Filling the room were a series of disturbed, demolition deposits of turf and stone [243], [473], [450], [345]). Similar deposits ([266], [530], [542]) occurred in the entrance passage [1295]. A TPQ from these abandonment deposits gave a date of c.1730/1740. Infilling the passage [421] were various turf collapse layers ([380], [1231]) and smeared over the top, a more disturbed collapsed layer ([170], [367]). A TPQ from these deposits returned a date of 1700/1710. Infilling the passage [1608] was a series of turf dumps/deposits ([1610], [1667], [1668]), while external collapse from the western wall is represented by further layers ([1620], [1621], [1622], [1635]).",Priests Living Quarters,Prestbaðstofa,t

The walls ([2849], [684]) survived to a substantial height – c. 0.85m-1m on the south side, 0.85m on the east and 0.55-1.05m on the north, comprising four to five courses of undressed stones. The building was 9.5m long and 3.7m wide, with seven pairs of postpads on each side of the long walls; the eastern end was partitioned off into a separate space 3.1m long, marked by a stone sill (recorded as part of the floor, [1484]). There were only very thin and ephemeral traces of floor layer present [1484], confined to the northern half of the room which was associated with 18th century finds and a TPQ of 1700, while beneath that, the whole room was filled with thick turf mixed with wood debris and other material [1643]. The surface of the turf layer was excavated in two rows of 1m segments to control for finds distribution and better ascertain the nature of this turf layer. It did not appear to be a floor, but rather a sub-floor levelling layer. A TPQ of 1723 was associated with this layer. This layer was not excavated to its base as it seemed to go beneath the walls, suggesting that any earlier phase to this structure had walls in a different location. The lack of a proper floor is disconcerting and one scenario is that it had wooden floorboards; documentary sources however make no mention a wooden floor, the latest of which is from 1764. If the room did have such a wooden floor, it must have more or less completely truncated/cleaned out earlier ash/flagstone floors during a re-build, with [1484] being all that remains of these.  Running south from the building was a narrow, stone flagged passage [1733]; this passage probably connects to a suite of rooms at right angles to the refectory but laying beyond the southern limit of excavation and identified on historic plans as butter and meat stores. The passage was 0.7-0.8m wide and at least 2.7m long (it continued beyond the limit of excavation), defined by stone faced walls [1759] and a flagstone floor [1757]. The flagstone floor appeared to be contemporary with the floor layer [1484] in the main building. Based on the inventories, there was probably another passage parallel to this which was not identied in the field; however, examination of the wall elevations suggests the location of this other blocked passage just a few metres to the east.  This structure is clearly the building called the Large Room (Stora stofan) in all the inventories, but marked on the maps as a dining room (borðstofa). It is mentioned in the inventory from 1674 as being in this location and was newly re-built/repaired at this time. It was seven bays long, had a main door with a lock. Coming off it – presumably to the south – was another chamber, the same size but in much worse condition. In 1698, the building is now six bays long and had been repaired during the encumbency of Bishop Þorláksson (1674-1697), though its walls looked a bit worn. The walls were now panelled all around. Inside close to the front/west end of the room was a small chamber to store a watered-down whey (blönduklefe) with a slatted door on hinges. There was also a glass window at each end of the building, one of which was broken. Inside the main room were two high tables and two long tables with benches. Coming off the south side were now two chambers, both eight bays long and with doors at each end, those at the south having a lock, those at the north just a latch. The western chamber had ‚butter platforms‘ (smiorpallur) covering two bays indicating it was used as a butter store; it is marked as such on the 1784 map .  By 1722, the room was in poor shape and had lost one of its long tables, and some of the wall panelling. Of the chambers to the south, the eastern one was also in poor condition, while the western one is only five bays long now (four of which were panelled) suggesting it may have been recently renovated. In 1744, the building is much the same and assessed as being in adequate condition (but with a beam broken). Of the chambers to the south, the eastern one had been repaired in 1743 but now the western one was in poor condition – yet now eight bays long again. No change is recorded in the 1747 inventory except the eastern chamber now has locks on both its doors. The drawing from 1745/6 depicts this structure but labels it the Old Dining Room (Gamla Borðstofa); it shows two buildings coming off it on the south south and probably attached (although the drawing is ambiguous); the western one is simply called Grásýða (and old term for a butter container or chest) and the eastern chamber a butter store (smiorklefi). In 1759 the building is described as newly repaired/re-built, but is otherwise the same size; no internal furniture is mentioned. Both chambers are also still present, the western one having recently been repaired (and now housing the ‚butter platforms‘) while the eastern one was in poor condition. By 1764, the building is in bad condition, with the eastern chamber having been recently repaired but the western chamber in poor condition. It is difficult to tie the archaeological remains to any of these descriptions; the presence of a chamber at the eastern end of the room, the probably presence of floorboards and the fact that access to both side chambers may have been blocked off suggests this building as excavated may post-date 1764. It resembles most closely the 1784 plan, suggesting it is just the final phase of this building. The passage [1733] clearly led into one of these chambers – most probably the western one; although no sign of a similar blocking to the east was identified in the field, looking at the drawing and photographs, it is likely one was in fact there. Even the western blocking was only discovered fortuitously. The walls and levelling layer for the building probably date to the interval between the 1722 and 1744 inventories.",School Refectory,stórastofan,t

Turf levelling was laid ([853], [858]) over which more ash floors had been deposited [843].  No dating came from this upper floor.  The 1744 inventory describes the same basic structure but the internal furnishings have changed somewhat; there is now only one bed, a table, chairs and small bench-seat, but the room also has a wooden floor. It has clearly been renovated.  On the 1745/6 plan the building is shown without any details; it is simply called a dormitory or sleeping quarters (svefnhus). It does however depict a central entrance with the length of the room equal on either side; this however is hard to square with the archaeological evidence and the inventory which describes a three-bay structure. The teachers room (locats húse) is still mentioned in the 1747 inventory in connection to the passage/corridor, but the building itself is not described. Possibly it was already in the process of being dismantled or empty. This is during a period when the whole school was being refurbished. By 1759, all mention of this building seems to have ceased suggesting it went out of use. By this time, both the school master and teacher (now called the rector and conrector) had moved into the loft above the school room (see Structure XXI). The abandonment/demolition of the building is marked by a series of turf collapse layers  ([971], [950]) within the entrance to the building, amidst which a Frederik IV gold coin dated to 1714 was found. The footprint of this building was later built over when Structure XXIX was erected. ",Assistant Teachers Quarters,locats hús,t

A random scatter of flagstones were associated with it, but the floor showed signs of disturbance. Indeed the interior surface of the building was relatively uneven due to the position of underlying walls from an earlier building. Both passages [816] and [1780] and the drain [1528] remained in use.  The 1744 and 1747 inventories both record the same details as the 1722 one, but both also remark on the poor condition of the building and that it is now old. The pantry however appears to have been re-furnished according to the 1747 document and the main door downstairs now has a lock on it. There are two tables, benches and chairs. In 1759, not much has changed except now there are five beds in the main loft area instead of four. The 1745/6 plan shows the structure with the loft space clearly marked and with square windows on both floors. The building there is labelled as giesta hús with a dungeon (diblissa) at the east end and a guest loft (giesta lopt) above; the dungeon may simply refer to the fact it was a locked/strong room. The plan also depicts the passage connecting this structure to the main corridor, although placing it central rather than along one side. ",Bishops Dining Room,Biskups borðstofa,t

Only parts of the northern end and middle remain; all traces of the southern end seem to have been completely erased by subsequent levelling. What remains of the building is defined by a section of the northern wall ([381], [403]). Of these two sections, wall fragment [381] is probably a later rebuild, blocking a probable passage [505] connecting this structure with Structure V to the north (see Structure V, S5.3). Beneath wall [381] were a series of mixed turf and stone deposits ([1299]: [370], [1407], [1413]) which may represent debris from remodelling of this north wall. A TPQ of 1775 was associated with the earliest of these layers, which went beneath [381], dated to c. 1800.  The width of the structure is hard to ascertain as there seem to be multiple phases including a possible shifting of the eastern wall; an estimate would suggest it was probably originally c. 3.2m wide and c. 8.3m long, comparable to the adjacent structure VIII. A wide passage connects the two structures, defined by a disturbed flagstone floor [309], which was flanked by a turf and stone wall to the south [378]. A TPQ for this flagstone floor returned a date of 1739. The northern side is unclear; smaller flagstones forming a paving surface ([274]/[1459]) lay north of the main passage floor, separated by turf deposit [287]. These may be an earlier/ later section of the passage, indicating it size or position had changed. The passage continues west for 8m, although its middle section has all been truncated. The western end of the passage and the northern chamber were similarly covered in flagstones over turf levelling [175], which were associated with a TPQ of 1753. Traces of earlier floors ([240], [260], [275]) in the northern half survived, but only close to the wall; a TPQ of c.1750 was associated with one of these deposits. The stones in the earlier floor suggest the structure might originally have been on a slightly different alignment.  This structure is the new house mentioned in the 1744 inventory which was built over the Miðbadstofa (Structure XI). It was divided into two rooms, both with wooden panelling and floors and a separate stairway to an upper level, which was also divided into two rooms. Each room had a lockable door, a new one for the south room and an older/re-used door for the northern chamber. Overall it was eight bays long and had nine glass windows. In each of the two rooms downstairs was a bed, with a round table in the south room and a square table in north room. There was one bed upstairs. It is described as all well made and new. There was a door ready for the south room in the loft but not yet installed. In 1747, the house is similar but now has a chimney and oven and with shutters added to four of the windows. In 1759, it seems to have lost one bay as it is now only seven bays long, but is otherwise the same except for an extra bed in the loft. It is starting to look worn. In 1764, the building is being called the New House (Nya Husid) despite now being over twenty years old. There are no substantial changes except the loft now had five beds, presumably the beds in the downstairs rooms having now been moved upstairs. The aisle between the two rooms also now seems to have a loft over it with a bed and locked door. One addition however is the construction of a passage linking this building to the Dining Room in the Bishop‘s wing (Structure V).  On the 1784 plan, this building is depicted as parallel to adjacent Structure VIII, where there is a single, joint corridor running through the middle of both buildings; this connection probably happened after 1764 as no mention is made of a connection between these buildings in the 1764 inventory where the buildings also occur in very different places in the order of description. Moreover, no passage exists connecting this and Structure V on the 1784 map, suggesting this passage had been removed by this time. The building does not seem to have been severely damaged by the 1784 earthquake, and no mention of it occurs in the 1784 report but in one from 1785 it is is described as being in usable condition. Significantly in the 1785 report, the building (called the Miðbaðstofa) is described immediately after the Nursery (Barnhusid), implying their connection. The abandonment of the building is marked by several, widely spread demolition layers ([166], [177], [236], [246], [294], [392]) which have probably also been mixed by later levelling. A small patch of peatash [375] lies under one of these layers and probably is associated with the 19th century farm. It is possible – based on the 1837 plan – that the southern part of this structure was re-built as an outhouse, but since nothing of this section survives it must remain only an educated guess.",Living Quarters,Miðbaðdstofa,t
55,S11.4,1740,1740,,"The internal dimensions of the structure remained the same, the main change appears to have been the construction of a northern doorway and passage [1295] in the northern wall. The northern, outer face of the wall ([1432]/[1433], [1429]) was rebuilt and associated with a TPQ of 1700 – but from an upper, disturbed section. The passage/doorway [1295] in the northern wall was 0.9m wide and 1.5m long. Associated with this modification was a mixed deposit containing red and white clay [1345] similar to that used in the wheystore (see Structure XV). The deposit – along which possibly disturbed floor layers ([2328]/[2325]) - lay under the new walls ([1305]/[1341]) of the passage [1295]. It is unclear what this clay deposit is doing in the room but it seems to be confined only to the construction of the passage. The surface of the new entrance was covered by a charcoal floor deposit [1339] and over that, stone flags [1294] which had been placed over a turf levelling layer ([1310]/[1297]). This was contemporary with a re-surfacing of the interior of the building which now seems to be divided into two equally sized halves based on differentiation in floor material. There was localized turf levelling layers ([1210], [1256]) and a flagstone surface ([276], [302], [322]) in the eastern room [2757] of the building, which also may have had a sub-division with a narrow space 1.4m wide at the far easternmost end. The TPQ from this flagged floor returned a date of 1730/1740. No sign of any new floors were identified on the western side, save for some very localized turf deposits against the western and southern wall ([1230], [1262]) which probably represent repairs to the postpads (and thus roof-bearing posts). In addition, a small, discrete dump of peatash [480] lay in the southwest corner of the building. However, a localized spread of red and white clay [1182] similar to that under the walls of the passage [1295], extended over the western room and central aisle, north of the drain and sump. A clay pipe fragment from the deposit returned a TPQ of 1630. As with the clay deposit in the passage, it is unclear what this represents but it may simply be redposited material incorporated into a turf levelling layer. The flagstones here may have been robbed – or this room had floorboards.  It is appears that the western passage [1608] was closed off at this time; the outer face of the western wall [1619] of the passage and the common wall for Structures XI and XII, has stones which run across the entrance of passage [1608]. If so, it suggests that the only entry to Structures XI and XII at this time was at the north side of Structure XI and may even explain why this door was inserted. This change also relates to changes in adjacent structures. To the west, the eastern wall of the kitchen (Structure X) was re-built with its western gable only c. 0.7m from the original entrance in passage [1608].   No inventory exists for this period so we possess no other source to confirm this possible alteration.  The abandonment of the building is broadly contemporary with the construction of Structure IX . Filling the room were a series of disturbed, demolition deposits of turf and stone [243], [473], [450], [345]). Similar deposits ([266], [530], [542]) occurred in the entrance passage [1295]. A TPQ from these abandonment deposits gave a date of c.1730/1740. Infilling the passage [421] were various turf collapse layers ([380], [1231]) and smeared over the top, a more disturbed collapsed layer ([170], [367]). A TPQ from these deposits returned a date of 1700/1710. Infilling the passage [1608] was a series of turf dumps/deposits ([1610], [1667], [1668]), while external collapse from the western wall is represented by further layers ([1620], [1621], [1622], [1635]).",Priests Living Quarters,Prestbaðstofa,
56,S12.2,1740,1740,,"South of Structure XI and forming an H-block with it via the connecting passage [421], is another building of similar size, 7.6m long by c. 3.3m wide, though this may be a later modification, especially to the western arm of the northern wall which may have originally been set flush with the eastern arm, thus making the room only c. 3m wide initially. The 1722 inventory implies the passage [421] was shortened by one bay, which would accord with this change. The eastern arm of the northern wall has a dog-leg just east of the entrance. Its southern wall and edge were completely truncated (either in the 19th or 20th century), but the remaining walls ([1637]/[1411]/[1261]/[1249]/[447]) were more or less intact if somewhat disturbed.   The interior was well preserved and included a fairly thick charcoal floor [1329]/[1396] and postpads [1414] for roof-supporting timbers. No primary turf levelling layer was excavated and possibly earlier phases of this room remain unexcavated. The pads survived best at the two ends of the room, creating a near continuous sill plate; only a few pads along the long walls remained in situ, specifically three in the northeastern section, spaced about 1.1m apart. It is likely 8 pairs of posts spanned the width of the room. Several timber planks [1340] also occurred within the floor, which are almost certainly the remains of floorboards. There were two distinct phases of floor, but they were excavated as one; evidence of repairs is suggested by the insertion of probable secondary postpads [1375] with turf levelling beneath [1382] along the northwestern part of the room. As such, this phase probably covers a fairly long time period. The TPQ from these floors returned a date of c.1730/1740, but by far most of the material dates to the later 17th century suggesting a long-term accumulation.  In the corner formed by the dog-leg along the northern wall was a sunken pit for a small barrel or cask [438] – just to the right of the entrance as one leaves the room or left as one enters. This seems to have replaced an earlier inglenook, though no real traces of this survives (see S.XI.1). The pit [440] was circular c. 0.5m in diameter and 0.45m deep, backfilled with a mixture of turf debris, peatash and charcoal [439]. At the base of the cut, fragments of the base of a stave vessel had survived in situ but were very badly preserved and could not be retrieved. A turf layer occurred in the dog-leg ([1395]) around the barrel pit with a mixed floor layer above ([1253]). A TPQ from the turf layer returned a date of 1723. If this dog-legged niche is the inglenook, then it is likely the barrel pit is a later insertion. Indeed, just east of the centre of the room was another, but less identifiable feature; sealed by the floor layer was an irregular depression c. 20 cm deep and 20 cm in diameter [1381], filled with floor material/charcoal with peatash lenses and stones. Finds were not common, but included coal – the latter particularly unusual, and rare in Iceland for the 17th century. This is tentatively interpreted as the remains of a robbed out fireplace and could indicate the stoking pit for or robbed foundation of a stove – likely connected to the inglenook mentioned in the 1698 inventory. One fragment of stove tile was found in the collapse/abandonment layers infilling the room suggesting this would have been a tiled stove.  The 1698 inventory calls this building the Middle Living Quarters (Miðbaðstofa) and is very similar to the adjacent building (Structure XI). It was five bays long, with panelled walls and a wooden floor. Access was via a double door (presumably from the connecting corridor), one with lock and the other just a latch; inside it was divided into two rooms. In one was a round table and benches with two glass windows while in the other was a small four-poster bed with a table, bench, shelves and one window. There was a spiral staircase leading up to a loft which extended over the whole building and had three beds, a small table and a glass window in each gable. By 1722, the building has been renovated and is now six bays long; however no divisions are mentioned, its only internal furnishings being a bed, table and bench; it had three glass windows and one door with a lock. There is no mention of the loft which presumably is no longer present. Archaeologically, no divisions were discerned in the floors of this building but since the primary phase had wooden floor boards, these are unlikely to have left any trace.  Infilling the room were a series of turf collapse/dumping layers ([413], [422], [429], [1292]). They returned a TPQ of 1740.",Living Quarters,Miðbaðdstofa,

Its primary associated floor was an iron panned, dark organic layer [139] with animal dung and wood chips, although the very basal part of the layer was cleaner, suggesting it may have had a different primary function. A TPQ of 1720 was consistently associated with both the new walls and the floor, but this phase is likely to be a little later and probably is contemporary with the re-building of Structure XXII (see S22.3) in the second quarter of the eighteenth century.  The 1744 inventory describes a newly renovated/re-built structure, now two and half bays long with one bed, one bench, a table with a drawer and two glass windows (one being broken); it still has two doors but only the outer one has a lock. By 1747, the whole school was being renovated and the School master‘s quarters were subsequently moved to the loft above the school room. This room had probably already been demolished by 1747 as it is not depicted on the drawing of 1745/6.  Marking the abandonment of the building and infilling it was turf wall/roof collapse ([128]).

Although some 19th century material occurs in these deposits, they are considered intrusive or due to erroneous excavation of later deposits – a not unlikely event given the often poor boundary resolution of contexts on the site. Associated with this infill was some re-building of walls. The northern wall ([1441]/[1462]/[1898]) was set back slightly by 0.4m from the original line while the western wall ([1453]/[1712]) was re-built producing a slightly longer building, 8.3m long and 3.1m wide. The southern end of the building seems to have barely survived – disturbed remnants of the southern end of the west wall ([431], [417]) were identified, and little of the south-eastern wall. Presumably if the south wall was gabled, this continued to be the case. Dating associated with these structural changes returned a TPQ of c. 1750. With this re-building also went a slight shift in the axis of orientation, as the structure rotated a few degrees clockwise. The door on the eastern wall was also moved southward by c. 1m. The original passage was blocked up [2321], which also served as the northern wall to the new passage. A TPQ of 1733 was associated with this blocking. The new entrance passage [731] was 1m wide and 1.9m long and led, as before, down to the main axial corridor, via seven substantial stone steps; the difference in levels between the corridor and this building at this time was c.1.2m.   No accumulated ash or other type of floor layers were found associated with this phase. The main constructed floor layer ([090]/[374]) was composed of iron-panned turf with occasional stone flags and returned a TPQ of c. 1750. It seems likely that the building was more substantially flagged but most of the flagstones were subseuqently robbed – or it had wooden floorboards, though these are not mentioned in the inventory. The best preserved area was by the threshold of the steps in the central aisle of the room where small flagstones remained in situ ([335], [334]). A TPQ of c. 1750 came from these flagstones. There is a suggestion that these flags belong to a central aisle which bisected the structure, aligned with the doorway; remains of a possible stone sill ran along the southern edge of this aisle and two probable postpads flank its western end. This would then have divided the structure into two rooms and a central aisle as also indicated in the inventory.  In the northern room [1133], some flagstones survive in situ against the northern wall. There was also a large stone c. 0.5m square, worked on its sides and with its upper surface smoothed and concave, embedded in the main floor layer, close to its centre but to the eastern side. It is unclear if this stone is in situ or was dumped in after abandonment, although its morphology and location might indicate the former. If so, its original use could have been as a work surface, perhaps as a grinding surface, although it would have stood low on the ground, only about 0.25m above the floor, suggesting a kneeling or crouching position if working with it. In the middle of the western wall of this northern room was a possible opening; there is a gap in the wall stones and running through this gap is a flagged surface [274] which would seem to connect this room to Structure IX to the west. The central aisle [1227] was rather poorly preserved, due to a later pit [324] and an excavation trench [185] from the 1980s, both of which cut through the middle of this aisle. Above the flagstones in the aisle was a lens of greyish silt ([348]/[349]) which had late 18th century finds. The southern room [1298] had no identifiable features at all – no flagstones, only turf deposits ([369]/[1431], [361], [356]), which are probably just part of the original levelling floor layer; it is possible it may have had floorboards, or simply that all traces of activity or features have been removed, a not unlikely scenario given the truncation to the southern wall of the building in this phase.  The 1764 inventory mentions that a new building has replaced the Nursery; it was much larger, six bays long however it also strangely states that it can be reconverted back to its original size. The new building had three glass windows on each gable, it was panelled all around and divided into two rooms with four beds, benches, tables and lockable doors. There was a loft over the whole building, containing one bed. It is described as a considerable improvement over the earlier Nursery. No name is given to this new building but on the 1784 map, the northern room is called the miller‘s room (malarakamers) while the southern room the Priest‘s room (Prestakamers). It is likely the people living here changed over time, but they doubtless remained private bed chambers throughout. Sometime between 1764 and 1784, this building was connected to Structure IX to the west via the central passage, as indicated on the 1784 plan. The building does not seem to have been damaged by the 1784 earthquake, no mention of it occurs in the 1784 report and in one from 1785 it is is described as being in good condition. Here it is still called the Nursery (Barnhusid), but incorporating the Priest‘s chambers (Prestens Kamer)",Nursery/Private Chambers,barnhús/prestakamers,t

At the same time, the corridor walls were integrated with the eastern walls of Structures IV and V (but at slightly different times) with a passage into Structure IV and new passages constructed into Structure VIII and the newly added Structure XVI. The walls may also have been repaired or even rebuilt in places, especially along the eastern side and almost certainly on both sides toward the south end where they meet Structures XVIII and XIX. At their best, they survived to a height of c. 0.55m, but at the southern limit of excavation, its walls reached c. 1.5m. A sinuous drain [1117] ran the length of the passage, but all traces of the original floor/capstones [1137] to the drain had gone save in a few places: large flagstones survived under a later blocking wall at the southern end of the passage; further flags survived at the northern exit ([126]), and on the eastern edge of the side passage [974], where the haybarn (Structure II) truncated the passage and at the southern end [1473]. The drain would seem to be at the same level as the drain installed in the new dormitory (Structure XX, S20.4) dated to c. 1740-1750. 18th century finds were associated with these remnant surfaces. It is likely that similar sized flags occurred throughout the passage but were robbed after its abandonment. The drain sides themselves consisted of solid stone blocks and turf [1034], and this was excavated in six 5m segments. It is likely there was a drain here earlier which was re-built, although little survived of this (except perhaps a primary fill in the northern section) and the TPQ from these side stones returned a date of 1730/1740. However, the earlier drain would most likely have just been repaired using the same stones. In the side passage [106], most of the drain side stones seem to have been robbed [1106], only a short section was extant at the west end [1114] and east end [1094]. Some other turf and stone floor deposits also survived at the very eastern end ([983], [985], [987]). The drain fill [784] was excavated in 1m segments and returned a TPQ of 1767. At the northern end of the corridor only and in the side passage [106], a primary fill [793] was also excavated. This returned a TPQ of 1720. It is possible this primary fill belongs to an original/earlier drain which only ran between the side passage and the northern section of the corridor though given the drain in passage 1780, it is more likely the earlier drain ran the whole length of the corridor.  The sides of the drain were overlain by small flagstones and turf ([669]/[1125], [686]), used to level the surface beneath the flagstones and these were similarly excavated in 1m segments to control for artefact recovery. A wide range of dates came from this layer which probably indicates its usage/maintenance over a long time period but a consistent TPQ is c. 1740. The drain seems to have been retained and in use for as long as the corridor, and although it shows no clear evidence of modification, the capstones [1137], which also doubled as the floor, had possibly been raised and the sub-floor leveling layer [669] added to over time – especially if the corridor was narrowed. Certainly both part of the sub-floor leveling layer [669] and the sides of the drain [1034] continued beneath the extant walls [1283] of the corridor but abutted a lower course [1152], set back from the upper wall.   The 1759 inventory mentions the corridor as needing repairs and by 1764 it is in need of further maintenance. The 1785 report on the earthquake damages assesses the corridor as being in usable condition; it may well have been recently renovated. The 1745/6 drawing shows the main corridor with a pitched roof as one might expect; the southern door is clearly a larger space, like a vestibule, and indeed the corridor is clearly double the width here from the archaeological plan. The 1784 plan shows the corridor as one continuous space; in both drawings, the north and south entrances are labelled as North door (nordurdyr) and Man‘s door (kalldyr) respectively.",Main Corridor,Göng,t

Possibly the lack of a functioning drain may have made increased dampness in the floor. Eight postpads survived on the south side and nine on the north side – one from the south side probably being robbed/disturbed. The pads are spaced on average c. 1.5m apart. Close dating came from the turf levelling under these postpads with a TPQ of 1744.   At the same time, fresh ash deposits were laid over the central aisle of the floor. The floor ([2334]/[2249]/[2242], [2141], [2203]) extended through the eastern half and into parts of the western end of the room as well as into the passage [2304]. Finds from the floor all dated to the 18th century. The base of a stave vessel <9933> was embedded in this floor, in the north-east corner next to fireplace [3032]; it was very poorly preserved but made from pine. Both fireplaces probably remained in use at this time. Fireplace [3032] was badly disturbed as already mentioned, and a series of mixed deposits ([2600], [2460], [2451], [2455], [2231], [2213]) in the northeast corner are probably all disturbed hearth or hearth-related layers, consequent to the repairs of the room. A TPQ of 1730-40 came from these disturbed hearth deposits.  A micromorphology sample (s.304) was taken through these floors for thin-sectioning and analysis, also catching the upper floors of the previous phase [2391]. About sixteen different lenses were identified. At least seven or eight thin distinct blackish brown floor surfaces with a massive to platy structure with organic rich turf strips layed down between them. In one or two places uneven surfaces seem to have been patched up with larger charcoal fragments, ash and woodchips. Within the upper sequence only low quantities of very small fragments of bone (<1 mm) were recorded. The 1759 inventory mentions the building has recently been repaired but is otherwise unchanged. In 1764 the first mention is made of a partition dividing the room which has a door with a lock – as does the main door into the building. No obvious signs of such a partition were seen archaeologically except perhaps the lack of new floors at the westernmost part of the building, suggesting a possible partition here, although the inventory implies a division in the middle which suggests it separates the ovens into two rooms.",Meat Store,kjötskemma,t

This has resulted in much fewer finds and consequently, less scope for close dating. Dating of this and subsequent phases are thus largely speculative. The new structure was of similar width to the last, c. 3.6m wide, the main change appearing to have been moving the northern and southern walls further south by 0.5m. However, it may have been somewhat longer as the eastern end extended much further east now, resulting in an estimated building length of c. 10m. The whole level of the room was also raised, although little evidence of this seems to have survived except for turf packing ([253], [263]), which seems to have been deliberately laid into the top of the drain [308]. This would have made the structure at the same level as the main axial corridor and it is likely that the new drain [113]  would have connected up with drain [1117] in that corridor. Indeed, the re-build of this structure is broadly contemporary with that of the corridor (see S13.2).   Where present, the inner wall face [1043] of the building survived to a height of c. 0.3-0.45m; the outer wall face was more fragmentary but a section on the north side survived [099], built over possibly dismantled earlier wall [122]. The southern wall [758] was only preserved on its inner face, the outer part truncated by the 20th century barn and silo although an outer edge seems to have survived, recorded as part of  [748]. The walls seem to have been c.3m thick. Along the inside edge of the wall at regular intervals at the base were large, flat-topped stone blocks interpreted as post pads. The room had a centrally placed opening 1.05m wide on its eastern side for access with the adjacent school room Structure XXI.   The primary floor layers associated with this newly- re-modelled structure were dark, organic-rich layers with birch twigs and bark, some decomposed hay, and occasional flagstones ([102], [095]). The TPQ from these floors was 1700. These were associated with a new drain [113]. The original cut of the drain [117] was 1m wide and 0.3m deep, lined with stone blocks [115] c.0.2m square and flat stone capping flags [114]. The stones had been disturbed and partially robbed out. The fill of the drain [116] was almost waterlogged and organically rich and associated with a TPQ of 1700. Like the earlier drain, it ran from east to west and although largely truncated, it probably fed into drain [1117] in the side passage [106] of the axial corridor (Structure XIII).  The 1747 inventory describes the building as in the process of being re-built – along with the school masters rooms and the adjacent passage. By 1759 the new layout is evident, but appears largely the same: five box beds on each side of the room, each with a hinged door. The beds were set between posts which probably acted as roof-bearing posts so the size remained five bays. The 1764 inventory states that the building was re-built using old and new timber six years earlier (in 1758) and made slightly narrower. It otherwise kept the same layout with five box beds on each side of the rooms. However complaints written in 1763 mention that the dormitory is too small, with only ten beds – clearly insufficient for student numbers. ",School Dormitory,skólaskáli,t

The walls and fireplace were re-built. The long walls on the east and west sides ([859], [841], [872], [776]) survived to a height of 0.55m in the north but only 0.15m at the south, while the northern and southern walls probably had timber gables as indicated by a row of stones at each end [783] serving as a wall plate. The southwestern corner had been truncated by a silo associated with the haybarn in the twentieth century. The newly re-built structure was now much longer, but also much narrower, at 9.4m long and 3.1-2.8m wide, noticeably sloping down from the north by 0.25m, with stone blocks [774] serving as post pad stones placed regularly (c. 1.4m between each, at the centre point) along the sides of the walls marking out seven bays. The fireplace [153] was only half as deep as before (c. 0.6m). New walls were constructed in a U-shape ([511/1086]) with flagstone base and the cavity left by the back part of the original fireplace was infilled with turf [510]. The new fireplace had an internal area similar to the original, of 1.2m by 0.5m. This also had remnants of firings ([143/503]. A TPQ of 1733 is associated with the re-construction of the fireplace.  The primary floor associated with this re-build was turf [149]/[848], associated with just two localized and small patches of charcoal/ash floors ([817/159], [846]) which may even be disturbed earlier floors. In general, there were no clear accumulated ash floors associated with this room, which probably indicates it had wooden floor-boards which is supported by the inventory. A TPQ of 1720 was associated with the turf floor [149].   These changes probably relate to the re-building that was underway during the 1747 inventory; the 1759 report describes the new layout, which remains seven bays long, but the building now has a loft where the schoolmaster and assistant (rector and konrector) reside which was furnished with beds, tables, windows and a lockable door.  There was no obvious sign archaeologically where access to this loft may have been, but it would have been via a simple ladder, given no mention of a staircase is made in the inventory. The house was built from Norwegian timber, had eight glass windows, panelled walls and a timber floor as well as benches. By 1764 however, the building was already deteriorating and lost two of its windows. In 1763 there is a documented complaint about the state of the school, which is described as cold and draughty – the gables had gaps letting in the wind and tables were missing. Again, there is no mention of the inglenook.",School Room,skóli,t
64,S22.4,1750,1780,,"In the final occupation phase of the structure, the floors were re-surfaced again. Turf levelling was laid ([853], [858]) over which more ash floors had been deposited [843].  No dating came from this upper floor.  The 1744 inventory describes the same basic structure but the internal furnishings have changed somewhat; there is now only one bed, a table, chairs and small bench-seat, but the room also has a wooden floor. It has clearly been renovated.  On the 1745/6 plan the building is shown without any details; it is simply called a dormitory or sleeping quarters (svefnhus). It does however depict a central entrance with the length of the room equal on either side; this however is hard to square with the archaeological evidence and the inventory which describes a three-bay structure. The teachers room (locats húse) is still mentioned in the 1747 inventory in connection to the passage/corridor, but the building itself is not described. Possibly it was already in the process of being dismantled or empty. This is during a period when the whole school was being refurbished. By 1759, all mention of this building seems to have ceased suggesting it went out of use. By this time, both the school master and teacher (now called the rector and conrector) had moved into the loft above the school room (see Structure XXI). The abandonment/demolition of the building is marked by a series of turf collapse layers  ([971], [950]) within the entrance to the building, amidst which a Frederik IV gold coin dated to 1714 was found. The footprint of this building was later built over when Structure XXIX was erected. ",Assistant Teachers Quarters,locats hús,
65,S30.4,1750,1750,,"In this phase the structure was made narrower and shifted further north; its walls were brought inward to make a smaller internal space. It now extended only 1.6m (north-south) into our excavation area and was 2.9m wide (east-west); based on the description, it was of similar or slightly longer than originally, most of it (including the door) falling beyond the limit of excavation to the north. The walls ([854]/[882]) survived to a height of c. 0.4-0.6m. Its primary associated floor was an iron panned, dark organic layer [139] with animal dung and wood chips, although the very basal part of the layer was cleaner, suggesting it may have had a different primary function. A TPQ of 1720 was consistently associated with both the new walls and the floor, but this phase is likely to be a little later and probably is contemporary with the re-building of Structure XXII (see S22.3) in the second quarter of the eighteenth century.

Even what had survived was very badly disturbed and stratigraphic relations between and identification of layers were very difficult to discern, resulting in no confident phasing. The main feature in the room consisted of a drain [2560] which ran from (and cut slightly into) the southern wall ([1706]/[2547]/[1126]/[1136]) of the building. The drain was defined chiefly by a cut [2126], but all side stones and fills had clearly been removed/disturbed as the channel was filled with stone rubble and turf ([2117], [2113]). The drain may have mirrored that in Structure VI to the south (see S6.2), in which case it may have turned east and fed into the drain in the main corridor (Structure VII). If so, it may also date originally to the mid 18th century.   The floor east of the drain was flagged ([1162], [1244], [1155], [1160], [1190]) and associated with turf levelling deposits ([2108], [2107], [1499]), many of them disturbed. These easternmost floors appear to be the most intact, especially [1160] which probably dates to the 18th century and is contemporary with [1456] in the main corridor (Structure VII, phase S7.2). A stone sill threshold [1452] ran across the eastern end of the room, marking a probable timber wall/screed dividing the building from the corridor – based on deposits sealing it, this sill plate dates to the 18th century. To the west of the drain, more fragmentary deposits marked similar, disturbed floors with flagstones and turf ([991], [1135], [1208], [1216], [1195], [1143], [1233], [1235], [1240]). There was little to date the deposits in this room but a TPQ of 1840 came from ceramics and 1860/1880 from a wire nail, both associated with one of the floor layers.   On the whole, most of the layers in this structure probably belong to the latter half of the 18th century and the earlier 19th century. On the 1784 century plan, the room is marked as a food store/pantry (búr) and the 1784 inventory and earlier ones also refer to it as a store room (skálaskemman). The first mention of the structure is in the 1722 inventory where it is described as being in good condition; it is likely to have been built at the same time as Structures IV, V, VI and VII, that is c. 1720 which would have made it fairly new still at the time of the 1722 inventory. The structure is described as six bays (stafgólf) in length and with timber panelling in the walls and ceiling, and with a locked door. The 1744 inventory states that is was recently renovated but apart from an additional door at the front, it otherwise is unchanged. The 1784 plan shows doors at each end of the structure. A drawing from c. 1745/6 labels the building as pantry-living room (búrstofa) with windows at the gable end, though no windows are ever mentioned in the inventories for this structure. This could be because the windows were not from glass.  Despite being renovated, the 1747 inventory already mentions some wear to the walls and by 1759 it is described as in need of renovation. For some reason, the 1764 inventory omits this building though it re-occurs in the 1784 review of the state of the houses after the earthquake; there it is described as still standing but near to collapse and unusable with timber beams broken, the walls cracked and the roof hanging down in places. It is likely the building was re-built or at least repaired as it is depicted on the 1836 plan as a two-roomed building, the eastern one being a kitchen (with a stove) and fuel store and the western/inner room as a dry food and dairy store. It thus seems to have retained its storage function over time. There is no further detailed information about this building but it is likely it was demolished with the other structures after the 1896 earthquake prior to the new farmhouse being built in 1897/8. The excavated remains discussed here are probably from the later period of this documented house, i.e. from c. 1760 and up until the 1840s. Earlier and later traces remain unexcavated and/or truncated.",Pantry/Stores,búr/skemma,t

This passage [1266] was long (c. 2.4m long by 0.3m wide) and had a flagstone floor [1367]. Beneath the flagstones were a series of turf levelling layers ([1368, 1373, 1374, 1383]) and a more silty accumulation [1379]. Also in this phase, a drain seems to have been constructed through the middle of the building; the 1744 inventory mentions this drain as a new feature so it is likely that the drain assigned to this phase is a re-build/repair rather than an original construction. The drain [499] connected with a main drain in the western corridor (Structure VII). The drain cut [519/1777] was lined with stones [518] and capped with flagstones [516]. There were multiple drain fills (primary: [1753], [679]) as well as mixing in of floor material ([676], [632]). Dating from clay pipe fragment associated with the side stones gives a TPQ of 1758 for this drain construction, while there is a TPQ for the primary fills of 1767.   Associated with this drain was a series of new floor layers divided now into two rooms. At the eastern end in room [797], a small patch of turf and woodchip levelling layer [715]/[712] was laid with new flagstones [145]/[800] associated with a TPQ of c.1760; the larger western room [798/9] was similarly re-surfaced with turf and some woodchip ([541], [574], [828], [883]) and some paving stones [358]. The westernmost part had the same turf levelling ([827]/[903]) with deposits of turf and stone flags ([680], [711]) and flagstone paving (801], [802]).The stove [934] was still active and possibly underwent some repairs as indicated by the turf and stone construction [575/717] which was sealed by a localized ash dump [624].  Unfortunately, the 1764 inventory omits a description of this building (as with Structure III) so we lack any comparative details.",New Hall/Dining Room & Chambers,skáli/borðstofa,t

In addition, an entrance seems to have been constructed through the centre of the southern wall. The entrance [505] was marked by an opening 1.3m wide with a sump [496] beneath a flagstone paving [484]. The 1764 inventory records a new passage connecting this building to Structure IX, which is probably what this doorway represents. The northern wall appears to have been un-modified. Associated with this narrowing was the dismantling of drain [1528] and the re-building of a new, centrally aligned drain [264], running from the eastern end where passage [816] enters and westward into the corridor [1702], where it joined drain [1287]. It had a linear cut [317], lined with stone blocks [273] and capped with large flagstones [265/544]. The fill [268] was turfy, which probably dates to the abandonment of the drain in the 19th century; the only dateable finds associated with the drain come from this fill and the capstones, and both give a TPQ of 1800 which should be interpreted as belonging to the final phase of drain use (see S5.5). The eastern terminus of the drain probably indicates the eastern end of this structure was still partitioned off as a separate room where passage [816] joins.  Contemporary with these re-builds, an extensive construction/levelling layer [1322] covered the interior of the structure, especially along the edges ([1206], [1228], [1178], [1006]), some of which were associated with reset postpads ([1342] [1361]). The eastern gable end was possibly re-built as there were also fresh levelling layers here ([1250], [1337]). Over these prepared surfaces in all the rooms had accumulated/was laid an organic rich floor deposit of wood and birch bark [932]/[1003], although a bone-rich, silty deposit [1196] lay against the southern wall. The TPQ for this floor is 1758.   The 1764 inventory seems to show no major changes to the layout of this building, only that it is in some need of repair and has three broken windows.

The western gable however does appear to have been replaced by a stone and turf wall [2271] sometime during this period. The chamber [2214] seems to have been widened westward to at least c. 3.5m if not all the way to the end making it c. 6.3m wide, as suggested by the 1784 plan (see further below). The 1759 inventory mentions its width as two and half bays which suggests a width of c. 3.8m. It seems likely that the westernmost room depicted on the 1784 plan is a later modification, built after 1759. In room [2214] the fireplace/stove seems to have been removed, the floors were re-laid with turf ([2142], [2233]) and then flagstones [2121] on the eastern side; the western end was too disturbed but based on the delimited area of flagstones, this probably had a different floor and was probably a different room. The 1784 plan depicts two rooms. In the eastern room [949] of the main structure, new floors were laid (and probably the timber floorboards removed). A turf levelling layer was put down ([1930], [1933], [1377]) over which had accumulated or was spread, ashes from a hearth ([1938], [1929], [1183], [1223]). A TPQ from these floors returned a date of c. 1760. At the same time it seems that two drains were added, one to the eastern room and one to the western. In the eastern room, the drain [1198] ran south from within the northern wall [1706] and through the middle of the eastern room then dog-legging to the east along the centre and through the doorway into the central corridor where it joined drain [1287]. Its location in the northern wall is somewhat unusual but a contemporary drain [2560] in Structure III to the north appears to do the same thing (see S3.1). The drain was constructed of sidestones [1209] set within a cut [1543] and with a primary fill [1520]. Capstones ([1197]) survived in situ only along the middle section of the drain. The disuse of the drain was marked by infilling [1224] and collapsed capstones ([1212], [1201], [1204]). In the western room [972], a very damaged drain [1328] ran at a slight angle as if from the bend in drain [1198] and down to the southwestern corner of the room. Very little survived – a row of disturbed side stones [1334] on the north side but better preserved on the south [2103] and with turf infill [1333], but no capstones or obvious drain fill. Indeed, the whole western room was very poorly preserved, with only a fragmentary and very disturbed turf levelling layer [1301] extant; contamination from later disturbance gave a TPQ for this layer of c.1840 although there were also 18th century finds in the deposit.   For some unknown reason, the building is not included in the 1764 inventory. The 1784 plan depicts a structure with four rooms: two larger rooms at the north, a front (eastern) room (fremstastofa) and main (western) room (stórastofa), which correspond to rooms [949] and [972] respectively; at the southern side, two other smaller rooms run for half the length of the structure: a library at the far west and a slightly larger Bishop‘s chambers to the east, the latter of which corresponds to room [2214]. The report on the state of buildings after the 1784 earthquake describes this building as badly damaged, its timber frame broken – but braced to keep it up. The walls are falling down, the roof is split and the chimney cracked. It was considered unfit for use.",Bishops Living Quarters,Biskups baðstofa,t

Most significant perhaps was the construction of a drain [1287], which ran through the middle of the corridor and just to the outside. The cut [1487] was lined with side stones ([1686]/[1406]) and had a primary fill ([1690]/[1415]). A TPQ from this fill gave a date of 1807, but given that the drain was probably in use a long time, this date should be read with caution, especially as there were predominantly 18th century finds in the fill. The same dating anomaly occurred with the continuation of the drain as it ran through the courtyard. Finds associated with the drain construction are certainly consistent with an earlier date and indeed stratigraphically, the drain was clearly built at the same time as drains [499] in Structure VI, [264] in Structure V and [1198] in Structure VI, all of which have been dated to c. 1760.   Some time after the installation of a drain, the width of the corridor appears to have been narrowed to c. 1.6m at the southern end by the construction of a solid turf and stone wall at the western end of structure V in c. 1780 (see S5.4). It is possible the north wall of this structure was also extended, making the corridor symmetrical, although this area was too disturbed for this to be seen. At the south end of the corridor, a new turf and stone floor was laid ([1625]/[1613]) which returned a TPQ of 1740/1750 over which the re-build ([1614]) of the southern wall of Structure V was constructed. Abutting the new wall extension were a series of flagstone and turf deposits at the very threshold of the corridor ([1215], [1566], [1572], [1545]), which gave a TPQ of c. 1770. At the north end, the corridor was re-surfaced with flagstones ([1456]/[1419]), contemporary with the flagged floor [1162] in Structure III. These abutted the projecting stone faced floor [1716] in Structure IV.   The corridor is not described in the 1764 inventory. In the report on damages from 1784 effected by the earthquake, it is described as unusable – its walls and roof having fallen in. Most if not all the layers ascribed to this phase probably pre-date this damage. The 1784 plan only shows a single, linear and undivided space as this corridor.",Vestibule & Corridor,göng,t

What is probably repair debris was excavated along the external north face of the wall ([1936], [1942], [1947], [1924], [1920], [1964], [1965]). A TPQ of 1730/40 was associated with this debris. The main changes involved re-surfacing the floor and re-building the drain. On the eastern side of the structure, the whole floor and eastern drain were sealed with a turf layer [1688] while over that lay an accumulated deposit of turf mixed with charcoal and peatash [1535]. On the western side of the structure, a more confined turf patch layer [1828] sealed the western arm of the drain while a more extensive turf layer with some mixed charocal [1546] covered the earlier floor. Scattered flagstones occurred in the floors, most extensively at the western side close to the wall. The TPQ from these floors gave dates of 1758/1760. The central section of the original drain was cleaned [1166] and completely re-built ([1500]. The sidestones (1165/2244], [2043]) were re-set or repaired within the old cut and filled by primary drain silts [1213] (which we excavated in segments). A TPQ of 1767 was associated with this primary drain fill, but it appears as if the drain was soon after laid with a flagstone base [1189], over which further fills accumulated (secondary: [1179]/[1952]; tertiary: [1164]/[1951]. The TPQ from these secondary deposits returned a date of c. 1800. The only other feature in the building was a small, shallow bowl-shaped pit [1537] marked by a circular cut [1539] 60cm in diameter and 12cm deep set dead centre in the eastern side of the building. Inside was a fill [1538] of floor material. Given the profile of the pit, it is unlikely to be a barrel pit – it may simply mark the removal of a large stone or even a stone feature such as an oven.  There is no mention of the kitchen in the 1764, but many other buildings are also omitted for some reason. It is however listed in the damages to buildings after the earthquake of 1784 where is it described as having fallen down and the chimney being cracked. The plan from 1784 shows the building with an entrance placed centrally on the north side, although no chimneys/ovens are marked in.  The abandonment of the building is marked by several collapse/demolition deposits from the walls/roof, most of them extending north of the building ([1839], [1485], [1465], [1466], [1247], [1241], [2115], [1207], [621], [586], [576], [347/614], [289], [282]), though some lay over the north wall itself ([1127], [1128], [1129], [1118], and some were extensively spread north of the structure ([1443/623], [1486]). A TPQ from these latter deposits returned a date of c. 1870, while a TPQ of 1820/1830 was associated with the deposits closer to the north wall. These numerous deposits of structural debris probably represent a long-term process of weathering and possibly even traces other building activities no longer visible. Some other turf layers extended over the eastern end of the building ([1108], [1104], [172]), but at the western end the ground had been levelled to just above the floor level from the previous phase. It is likely that a lot of material has been truncated over this structure – possibly even a later phase of the building. The 1837 plan shows an outhouse which could be in this location, but no evidence of any 19th century features survived except perhaps a short segment of wall [1889]. The only indication of activity was some early 19th century material in the abandonment deposits infilling the top of the drain ([1159]/[1501], [1150]), which gave a TPQ of c. 1800.",Kitchen,Eldhús,t
73,S14.1,1760,1800,,"The passage [1269] into the cathedral was largely excavated by Kristján Eldjárn in the 1950s where two phases were identified, an earlier dated to the mid-15th century and a later one from the mid 17th century. The earlier one was associated with a drain, though Eldjárn thought the drain could still have functioned while the upper phase floor was in use. A section of the southern end of the passage survived beneath the modern reconstruction but it is somewhat unclear how this relates to Eldjárn‘s two phases. In terms of elevation and the presence of the drain, it would seem to relate to his earlier phase floor (i.e. Gólf II). However, this raises questions over Eldjárn‘s dating of the earlier phase excavated in the 1950s. Indeed, the recovery of clay pipes and vessel glass from the earlier phase might suggest that both phases of the passage Eldjárn excavated date after the 1600s. On the other hand, his later phase clearly has the schoolmasters room coming off its western side (see Structure XXX) and this structure we have dated to c. 1670-1750 which fits well with Eldjárn‘s dating for his later, upper phase. The best explanation we can offer here is that there must have been some steps down from the end of the long passage as it entered the school, accounting for the difference in elevation. The drain may still have linked up with Eldjárn‘s earlier phase as Eldjárn coinsidered the drain could well have functioned into the later phase while the 17th century finds associated with the earlier phase could simply relate to the final phase of activity.  What survived in our excavations consisted of a section of the western wall [1099/1080] and parts of a flagstone floor/capping [1149] over a drain [1280], composed of sidestones [1153] and fill [1151]. The drain would have probably turned to join the drain [1117] in passage [106], which in turn fed into the main drain of the corridor [751] (see Structure XIII). Most of this passage, as it survived within our excavation area, had been truncated by the haybarn (Structure II). No dating came from any of these layers. In terms of elevation though, it is probably contemporary with the re-building of the main axial corridor and the re-building of the school dormitory from the mid 18th century.  In the 1674 inventory, this is probably the ‚inner‘ passage to the school dormitory which is described as two bays long; it adjoins the under-passage to the church which was excavated in the 1950s. It gets only passing mention in subsequent inventories none of which add any information.  Over the floor and wall of the passage were various disturbed layers ([135], [1069], [1073], [1074], [1121]), associated with finds dated to the second half of the 18th century.",Corridor to Church,undirgöng,

The southern vat was taken apart and the hole filled with demolition deposits and turf. At the base of the southern vat, there appeared to be a trampled surface consisting of turf [1037] and ashes [1028] sealed by mixed turf and clay [1024], all of which are probably demolition deposits. Several layers of collapsed clay lining and turf infill was then used to seal off the southern cell ([1002], [980], [970], [937], [943], [916]). The northern vat also appears to have been dismantled and re-built; over demolition layers ([1061], [1055]) at the base of the original vat, a new cutting was made [852] c. 2m by 2m, cut down to a depth of c. 0.5m below the floor/base of walls and lined with timber panelling ([820]/[821]) and blue clay [819]. The floor beneath the vat was cobbled/flagged [875].  Associated with the re-modelling were new walls ([855]/[889]/[1124]) around three sides. The sides of the walls are leaning in, especially on the north and western sides suggesting they have been subsequently disturbed, which may also be related to the lack of stones on the northern edge if they had been robbed. Along the southern, eastern and western sides, there were also remains of a ledge or packing ([862]/[851]/[849]) between the sides of the vat and the cut. Essentially, the room was one large vat or tank, made water-tight by the clay and timber and would have been filled with whey which would have been scooped up with a bucket from the passage end. Access to the room, as before, was through a narrow passage [1270], which had a new flagstone floor [714] laid. A wooden beam may mark the location of a threshold/door jamb.  As in the previous phase, closely dateable finds were more or less absent. When this re-modelling occurred is therefore hard to say, as the documentary sources are fragmentary. It clearly post-dates 1759, which is the last description we have of the two-vat building. Certainly on the 1784 plan, only one (northern) vat is shown, which again matches the archaeological data for this phase. In the 1785 report on the condition of buildings after the earthquake it is assessed as being in good condition so presumably did not suffer much.  At the end of its life, the vat was probably taken apart and most of the wood re-used; infilling the room were a series of abandonment deposits: collapsed clay lining [815] sealed by wall/roof collapse [662]. In the passage [1270], a layer of turf [670] also sealed the floor, over a stone blocking [654] was constructed sealing the room off at the entrance from the main corridor into passage [1270]. A Sealing this were a series of layers of turf collapse that filled both the room and passage ([618]/[582]). TPQ from the primary dismantling of the vat gave a date of c. 1800. The uppermost layers of structural material infilling the room are more mixed and disturbed, probably during 19th century activities. These deposits ([506], [535], [534], [487], [495]) had a TPQ of c. 1850.",Wheystore,sýruklefi,t
75,S16.1,1760,1800,,"This was a badly preserved room, which has been truncated heavily on its southern half. Only its northern wall and the corner of the eastern wall [2761] survives as well as the northern part of the western wall it shares with the corridor. Its eastern and western walls at least appear to have been c. 1.2m thick. The building is 3.7m wide and the northern half, 2m deep; how far the room extended southward is difficult to say. The 1784 plan shows a room of equal size either side of the door, which would make its southern wall almost overlap the northern wall of the refectory (see Structure XIX; [690]), but there is just enough space to squeeze this structure in if the southern side was slightly shallower.  If so, it would make the building originally c. 4m long. There is a substantial step marked by a turf layer ([661]/[655]) at the entrance and it is possible there would have been a wooden ladder/steps here as there is a height difference of c. 0.25m between this step and the floor of the building. In other words, the floor of this room was much higher than the floor of the main axial corridor. Inside the structure, there were remains of a partially flagged floor [649] in the northwestern corner. There were few dateable finds from the building, some glass vessels returned a TPQ of c. 1650 from the floor, but the building is certainly much later.   This structure is not mentioned in any of the inventories, nor the reports on earthquake damage and nor on the 1745/6 drawing; its only documented existence is from the 1784 map where it is labelled as a store room (geymsluhús/skemma). It is probable it was built around the same time or soon after the wheystore (Structure XV) was reduced in size – although the dating of this is also uncertain. A very approximate date in the third quarter of the 18th century as been assigned to this building.  Upon abandonment, there were only a few patches of turf collapse ([645], [641], [396]) sealing the floor before the ruin was used to dump peatash (see Midden Area B).

A TPQ from this layer returned a date of 1730/1740. At the eastern end, there was a timber partition separating it from the axial corridor as before, marked by a wide flagged area (part of [1740]), with steps down into the lower level of the corridor itself. A short drain [1739] ran along the northern edge of the room about halfway in, running east, though it was somewhat disturbed. Sidestones [1756] and capstones (recorded as part of [1714]) were only preserved for a length of c. 5m, along with a drain fill [1738]. It probably replaced the earlier drain [2488] which may have continued to function in all previous phases, despite being sealed by multiple floors.  The primary floors in this room consisted of a central aisle of trampled ash, with three distinct phases excavated ([1656]; [1641]/[1644]; and [1640]/[1611]/[1609], including turf levelling [1636]). The sides of the room were partially flagged with flat stones. Along the south side were flagstones [1650] at the east end of the room, and on the north, at the west end, similar flagstones [1654].

This may have served as the foundation for a chimney. A TPQ of c. 1750 was associated with this platform. The western fireplace [2190] was built from three large stones set in a U-shape [2218] marking out an internal area of 0.2m wide and 0.35m deep, positioned within a cut [2603] and turf [2216]; it was 1m wide and 0.8-0.9m long (externally). The eastern fireplace [2189] was very similar, with a cut [2605]/[2492] in which three large blocks [2217] were set creating a U-shaped fireplace marking an internal area of c. 0.25 x 0.25m.  Various ash deposits ([2486], [2303]) had accumulated in the base and around the sides of the feature as well as a cleaning cut [2312]. Fireplace [2597] in the western half of the room was robbed and moved further west. Its replacement [2074] consisted of stone blocks [2148] arranged in a U-shape (internal space: 0.25m wide, 0.35m deep), set in turf ([2184/2187], [2147]). Primary hearth residues inside the fireplace were charcoal [2131]. A turf levelling layer ([2098/2133], [2243], [2247]) was laid in the middle and northeast corner of the room and into the passage [2073], and a substantial floor layer ([1958], [2100]) covered the whole room and passage, with flagstones [1955] at the westernmost end and in the passage [1962]. Raked-out peatash layers were found associated with both fireplaces ([1948], [2062], [2063], [2122]), while remains of the later hearth residues were found within both the north eastern ([1944], [1945]) and western fireplaces ([2075], [2065], [2064]). Finds from both the floors and the fireplace deposits all were broadly 18th century.  The plan from 1784 depicts the meat store as one open space with no partitions; a door to the outside lies at the western end. The report from 1785 on earthquake damage assesses the building as being in adequate condition but leaning a little.  At the end of this sequence, the building was probably deliberately torn down as wall and roof material [1860] covered the floor of the room. Thereafter, the ruin was used as a midden. Finds from the primary collapse generally had late 18th century material, with some glass bottles possibly from the earliest part of the 19th century. Above that were a series of peat ash dumps ([1732], [1776] and [1856]), interspersed with turf and stone collape/dumping ([1718], [1735], [1737], [1779]) which may represent continued and natural erosion of the ruin or deliberately dumped demolition material during periodic repairs and re-building of nearby structures. Finds from all these layers date to the late 18th century with a TPQ of c. 1750, suggesting the midden dumping did not continue far into the 19th century",Meat Store,kjötskemma,t

On the north side of the room in the centre, a low turf platform/levelling with stone revetting [1628] was built. Flagstones [1492/1495] were laid along each long side of the building while the central aisle had a trampled ash floor with at least two phases of accumulation ([1616]/[2066]; [1615]/[1493]). The primary phase of this central floor was composed of peatash and extended slightly into the passage [2326] where it was sandwiched between a turf levelling layer and floor belonging to phase S17.7, making it contemporary with this phase. A small turf patch [1626] lay beneath this peatash near the centre of the room. TPQ from the floor returned a date of 1767. Eight pairs of postpads [1494] were regularly spaced c. 1.5m apart along the edges of the room, and the room itself was possibly partitioned into bays, at least along the south side at the eastern end – here, traces of three timbers on the flagstone floor indicate possible cubicles. It is possible a similar arrangement had existed in earlier phases but there is little evidence for it.  The 1784 plan shows the building with a small storage room/cubicle in the southwestern corner. In the 1785 report on earthquake damage, the structure is said to be in good condition.  The abandonment of the structure was marked by a major and extensive deposit of turf collapse [1412] from the walls/roof, infilling the room. Only 18th century finds occurred in this collapse. Subsequently, not only this room but also the southern end of the corridor (Structure XIII) and the refectory (Structure XIX) had been used as a dump for peatash, all of which sealed this primary wall collapse.

The only positive evidence for later activity comes from the blocking of the passage [1733]. The whole passage was blocked off with a stone wall [1731] on turf bedding [1754] and the passage infilled with turf and stone rubble [1734]. The dating of this blocking is uncertain but must have happened before 1784 as no such passage is depicted on that plan; indeed, no obvious passage occurs on the earlier historic plan from 1745/6, though the drawing is more ambiguous as it shows the butter store right up against the south wall of the refectory. Based on the inventory descriptions, it would seem more likely that access from the refectory to these chambers remained into the mid 1760s at least. No dateable finds were associated with any phases of the passage.  Upon abandonment, the walls/roof of the building had collapsed into the structure ([1388]/[1480], [1394]). 18th century finds were associated with this collapse. As with the adjacent buildings to the west, the building had subsequently been used as a dumping ground for peat ash ([1362], [1321], [1308]; see Structure XVIII, S18.8).

Over this sub-floor levelling deposit lay a series of secondary, organically rich floor layers grouped as [059]. An iron pan layer [054] formed at the interface between the top surface of these floors and the overlying levelling deposit. Dating from these layers is similar to the previous one with a TPQ of 1700.   A micromorphology sample (s.4) was taken across all of these deposits for thin-sectioning and analysis from which about 10 different layers were identified. At the bottom of the thin section there are two layers of natural soil which represent the turf levelling layer [069]. On top of them was a thin dark brown floor lens rich in charcoal and bone fragments. The lens does not show significant trampling and most likely accumulated in an area without much traffic/trampling taking place. Above this virgin floor there are six to eight very thin dark brown to black lenses of floor with massive to subangular blocky and/or platy structures due to heavy trampling. The lenses are rich in silt sized charcoal and bone fragments. Slithers of horse hair and possible fragments of feathers were also identified. All the floor lenses are heavily truncated from left to right most likely by a single cleaning event. All these floor layers belong to [059]. Above the floor layers there is a thick massive layer of brown silt loam which can possibly be split into three lenses of turf. No evidence of trampling or large accumulations of charcoal/ash at boundaries, only rare charcoal fragments within the layers mostly < 1 mm. They could be interpreted as two or three layers of „clean turf“ layed down in a low activity area. At the top of the thin sections there are two lenses of reddish brown and brown „clean“ turf, possibly also laid down in low activity areas within the room. These could also be turf collapse. All of these turf layers relate to the abandonment infill layer [037] discussed in the next phase.  The 1784 plan shows the building with doors at each end; here it is labelled as the schoolroom (skólinn), which could either be an error or the rooms did switch functions. Off the southeastern corner is a small chamber labelled as the assistant teachers house (Conrectors hús). This must have been built after 1764 but before 1778 when it is mentioned in a letter about a possible location for a proposed infirmary. No trace of this structure was located and it is possible that it was built up at a higher level and/or has been truncated completely by the hay barn and silo constructed in the early 20th century. The 1785 report on the earthquake damage describes the building as seriously damaged and unusable.  The final phase of the structure is ambiguous but probably represents its abandonment; a deposit of turf and stone [037] lay within and over the walls and is probably structural collapse; however, it was covered by a small patch of floor-like material [029], rich in finds with a TPQ of  1740/1750. Either this is redposited from the cutting of the haybarn, or it represents remnants of a disturbed, but still broadly in situ floor.

The old fireplace was deliberately blocked in; the infilling comprised unstructured rubble [493] with a more carefully constructed face [136/482] made flush with the walls of the room. Mixed over the top of this infilling and blocking was redposited hearth material ([125/475]). Replacing it was a possible iron stove located at the southern end of the room. Here lay a stone-lined pit [840]; it was rectangular, 0.7m east-west and 0.3m north-south, and c. 0.25m deep, with stone and turf courses at the top and raised above the cut. Large stone flags were tipping into it which had probably once covered it. However, no fuel residues were found in the box which might cast some doubt on this interpretation.   Running north from this pit and east of the midline/off-centre of the building was a linear channel [154], 7.6m long,  c. 0.2m wide and 0.1-0.15m deep. Covering the channel was a line of stone flags ([132]/[833]), set on turf strips either side of the channel. This was built over/cut into the turf sub-floor levelling layer [149] covering the whole room.There is little doubt this feature could not have functioned as a drain – the conduit would have been water permeable, the fill [142] inside was simply clean turf/earth and not at all characteristic of a waterlain deposit, and any water which could have run through the conduit would simply have collected in the box at the end. During the excavation, the feature was speculatively interpreted as an under-floor heating system, the slope of the ground used not to carry water down as in a drain, but hot air up as in a flue, assuming the box at the southern end was the source of the heat via an iron stove. A similarly constructed conduit was excavated at Reykholt but associated with the hot pool and dated much earlier, to the 12th-14th century.  However, it is also possible that the flagstones mark a walkway through the middle of the room, the ‚channel‘ beneath, being simply an erosion face. On the other hand, it is assumed the building still had wooden floors as there was no sign any floor material which would make the flagstones odd as a walkway; alternatively they could have acted as a plate for a midline floor joist across which floorboards were laid though the terminal box feature and the slightly skew orientation makes this interpretation rather implausible.  The 1784 plan depicts the building with a door at the western wall; however it is labelled as the dormitory (skólaskáli); either the rooms switch function or, more likely, this is a transcription error. The report on earthquake damages from 1785 mentions that the building is in a usable condition but one window is missing and panes from many of the other windows are cracked or missing.  Infilling the building was disturbed turf wall collapse ([094], [088], [085], [760]).  Above this was more disturbed collapse and walls associated with a late nineteenth century structure (see S33). Outside the structure, on the eastern side, were some turf and stone deposits ([515], [549], [573]), mostly truncated by the cut for the byre (Structure I) which may represent collapse from the eastern wall. No dating was associated with them.",School Room,skóli,t
82,S4.3,1780,1800,,"Sometime before 1784, the access between this structure and both the corridor and building [1200] was closed off. Neither passage [816] or [1266] is shown on the 1784 plan, and assuming the plan is more or less accurate, the closures must have occurred by this time. Whether they occurred simultaneously or not is hard to say, but it is likely and in any case it certainly happened close in time. Passage [1266] was sealed by a blocking wall [1263] while passage [816] was filled with a series of turf/earth deposits ([814], [873], [1023], [1025], [1032]) and blocking stones [1031] at the south end.  Around the same time, the stove or fireplace in the middle of the structure appears to have gone out of use or been moved to the westernmost part; here a new stone-lined pit [757] was cut [545], lined on the northern edge with stones and yellow brick and filled with ash and burnt material [543]. It was sealed by a more extensive ashy spread [437] and associated rake-out [540]. Ash deposits [660] along the western edge of the room may also derived from this feature. This is probably an ash box for an iron stove or some form of raised and closed fireplace. Associated with these changes are new floors in each of the rooms: in the eastern room [797], more flagstones were laid [101], while the middle room [798] was covered by an extensive spread of ash [432] which may have come from either the original stove/fireplace in this room and/or the new stove in the western room. The western room itself was laid with turf and flagstones ([468],  [551], [520], [523], [532], [536], [685]) A discrete bone dump [548] lay at the westernmost end of this room, tipping into and sealing the lower drain fill of [499]. The drain [499] was certainly still in use at this time, and a series of secondary fills ([587], [517]) are probably contemporary with this phase.  The 1784 plan shows this building divided into three rooms of equal size, all being called chambers (instakamers, miðkamers, fremstakamers); it is possible that its use as a dining room had ceased and sometime c. 1780, the space re-organized for bedrooms. However the 1784 report still calls this room a dining room (spisestofan) so it was probably still connected with food consumption in some manner. The report on the state of buildings after the earthquake of 1784 describes this building as unusable: the roof had caved in and the walls fallen down. It is likely that most if not all the archaeological deposits from this phase date to a short period of the first half of the 1780s.",New Hall/Dining Room & Chambers,skáli/borðstofa,t
83,S5.4,1780,1800,,"In the last quarter of the century, the structure seems to have undergone substantial structural modifications. The eastern timber gable wall was replaced by a stone-faced wall, packed behind with unstructured turf/earth ([1290], [1313]; [1598]) mixed with an ash dump [1311], joining it up to the east wall of the main axial corridor [751]. The lowest infills of turf/earth ([1772], [1775], [1781]) were associated with a TPQ of 1780. This wall was also set back much further east, lengthening the room to 11.3m. Passage [1780] was blocked in at the same time. Also, the south wall was probably reduced in width to c. 1.6m except for a projection at the west end where the corridor was. Here, demolition debris from the earlier wall mixed with waterlain silts ([501], [512], [522]) lay under some external paving [490] (see Courtyard, C.2-3). The passage [816] in the north wall was also blocked off by [609]/[84] (see Structure IV). At the western end, a number of turf and stone deposits occur here in this phase ([777], [1033], [1614]) which sealed the earlier floor and are interpreted as the foundation for a turf wall replacing the earlier timber partition. This interpretation is largely influenced by the 1784 plan which depicts such a wall. Stone sills ([385], [388], [412]) seem to mark out three divisions; there was a complete lack of any real floor layers which probably indicates the presence of wooden floorboards and any partition walls may have been built over this. The interior of all the rooms had been re-surfaced with turf at this time: in [666] ([384], [626], [663]); in [709] ([350], [379], [362], [363], [415], [471], [633] and [644]); in [710] ([354], [464] and [467]); and in the new room [831] ([103/1222], [1238]). These deposits gave a TPQ of 1778 based on a coin. Apart from the drain [264] built in the previous phase, there were no internal features save a deposit of clay and bricks [328] against the southern wall of room [710], just east of the entrance. This is possibly the location of a stove setting. No stove tiles were found in this room, but at this date, an iron stove is not unlikely. A discrete dump of peatash [262] lay in the northern side of the adjacent room [709], up against one of the sills.   The structure is not specifically mentioned in the reports on the damaged caused by the earthquake of 1784, only its timber which was valued for sale; whether this means the building was ruined or not is unclear. It is possible it was renovated as indicated archaeologically, thus making it more sturdy. The 1784 plan shows the building divided into three rooms with a central aisle and entrance on the south wall (with no access directly into the corridor now).  The westernmost room is labelled a pantry (búr), separated by the aisle from two eastern rooms, a study (daglegtsetukamers) and a library (bókakamers) at the far east.",Pantry/Study & Library,búr/daglegtsetukamers & bókakamers,t
84,S29.1,1780,1800,,"This structure lies just south of the passage [106] which comes off the main axial corridor (see Structure XIII). It matches a building marked as an infirmary on the later plan from 1784. The infirmary was, according to documentary sources, the latest room to be added to the complex. Constructed sometime between 1771 and 1781; it was originally built as the Rector´s chambers, and after 1781, converted to an infirmary. It is possibly that shown in a painting by Dayes, dated 1789, standing alone and east of the main farmhouse. As excavated, the room was more or less complete except for truncation along its eastern wall by the haybarn (Structure II). The building was aligned north-south, 4.5m long and 2.7m wide, its western wall ([600]; [884], [888], [897]) surviving only to a height of c. 0.2m and thickness of 1.9m. It had been constructed over a turf levelling/infill layer ([123]/[778]) which extended beneath the walls of the building and sealed the earlier Structure XXII below. A TPQ of 1740 was associated with this turf infilling layer. Two posholes were found in the building, [1271] and [1272] on the southern side; they appeared to be sealed by this levelling layer but their position suggests they are contemporary with the use or at least construction of the building.   On its northern side, it opened directly onto the passage [106], possibly with a wooden panel frame over sill [1120] forming the northern wall with a doorway in it, while its southern side probably also had a wooden gable end, as there was only a single row of stones and no turf wall here. The basal layer associated with the room was a turf floor layer [108] with a TPQ of 1740; it may have been associated with wooden floorboards, although there was a patchy ash floor [612] in the centre. A TPQ of 1739 was given by a clay pipe fragment in this floor. Another linear dump of ash [1119] lay just outside the building, along its eastern wall and is probably contemporary with the building.  The first documented mention of this building is of a plan to build it, from a letter dated 1778, where there is discussion of the most appropriate site. The plans to build it may go back further as a complaint registered in 1763 explicitly mentions the lack of an infirmary. By 1784 the infirmary had clearly been built as it is shown on the plan from that year, just west of the school dormitory, with entry via the side corridor ([106]. No divisions are marked in the building. From the damage report of 1785, the building seems to have survived in good condition and so probably remained standing for some time.",Infirmary,sjúkrastofa,t
85,S17.8,1790,1830,,"The final occupation phase of the room is marked by a complete overhaul of the fireplaces; in the northeastern corner, the fireplace [3032] was partially dismantled/robbed and two new fireplaces were constructed as a pair [2188] set within a large cobbled platform [2196] which covered an area of 4.8m long and 1.65m wide, inclusive of fireplaces. This may have served as the foundation for a chimney. A TPQ of c. 1750 was associated with this platform. The western fireplace [2190] was built from three large stones set in a U-shape [2218] marking out an internal area of 0.2m wide and 0.35m deep, positioned within a cut [2603] and turf [2216]; it was 1m wide and 0.8-0.9m long (externally). The eastern fireplace [2189] was very similar, with a cut [2605]/[2492] in which three large blocks [2217] were set creating a U-shaped fireplace marking an internal area of c. 0.25 x 0.25m.  Various ash deposits ([2486], [2303]) had accumulated in the base and around the sides of the feature as well as a cleaning cut [2312]. Fireplace [2597] in the western half of the room was robbed and moved further west. Its replacement [2074] consisted of stone blocks [2148] arranged in a U-shape (internal space: 0.25m wide, 0.35m deep), set in turf ([2184/2187], [2147]). Primary hearth residues inside the fireplace were charcoal [2131]. A turf levelling layer ([2098/2133], [2243], [2247]) was laid in the middle and northeast corner of the room and into the passage [2073], and a substantial floor layer ([1958], [2100]) covered the whole room and passage, with flagstones [1955] at the westernmost end and in the passage [1962]. Raked-out peatash layers were found associated with both fireplaces ([1948], [2062], [2063], [2122]), while remains of the later hearth residues were found within both the north eastern ([1944], [1945]) and western fireplaces ([2075], [2065], [2064]). Finds from both the floors and the fireplace deposits all were broadly 18th century.  The plan from 1784 depicts the meat store as one open space with no partitions; a door to the outside lies at the western end. The report from 1785 on earthquake damage assesses the building as being in adequate condition but leaning a little.  At the end of this sequence, the building was probably deliberately torn down as wall and roof material [1860] covered the floor of the room. Thereafter, the ruin was used as a midden. Finds from the primary collapse generally had late 18th century material, with some glass bottles possibly from the earliest part of the 19th century. Above that were a series of peat ash dumps ([1732], [1776] and [1856]), interspersed with turf and stone collape/dumping ([1718], [1735], [1737], [1779]) which may represent continued and natural erosion of the ruin or deliberately dumped demolition material during periodic repairs and re-building of nearby structures. Finds from all these layers date to the late 18th century with a TPQ of c. 1750, suggesting the midden dumping did not continue far into the 19th century",Midden,öskuhaugur,
86,S18.8,1790,1830,,"The final phase of the building saw a major reworking of the floor [1491]. On the north side of the room in the centre, a low turf platform/levelling with stone revetting [1628] was built. Flagstones [1492/1495] were laid along each long side of the building while the central aisle had a trampled ash floor with at least two phases of accumulation ([1616]/[2066]; [1615]/[1493]). The primary phase of this central floor was composed of peatash and extended slightly into the passage [2326] where it was sandwiched between a turf levelling layer and floor belonging to phase S17.7, making it contemporary with this phase. A small turf patch [1626] lay beneath this peatash near the centre of the room. TPQ from the floor returned a date of 1767. Eight pairs of postpads [1494] were regularly spaced c. 1.5m apart along the edges of the room, and the room itself was possibly partitioned into bays, at least along the south side at the eastern end – here, traces of three timbers on the flagstone floor indicate possible cubicles. It is possible a similar arrangement had existed in earlier phases but there is little evidence for it.  The 1784 plan shows the building with a small storage room/cubicle in the southwestern corner. In the 1785 report on earthquake damage, the structure is said to be in good condition.  The abandonment of the structure was marked by a major and extensive deposit of turf collapse [1412] from the walls/roof, infilling the room. Only 18th century finds occurred in this collapse. Subsequently, not only this room but also the southern end of the corridor (Structure XIII) and the refectory (Structure XIX) had been used as a dump for peatash, all of which sealed this primary wall collapse. The peatash dumps ([1408], [1399], [1362], [1355], [1351], [1338], [1332], [1330], [1321], [1308], [1304/1316/255], [1303]) interdigitated with turf weathering/dumps ([1401], [1357], [1324]). Finds from all these layers date to the late 18th century with a TPQ of c. 1767; given the abandonment date of the structure, the ruin was probably only used as midden dumping for a short period.",Midden,öskuhaugur,
87,S19.3,1790,1830,,"If this building mostly had wooden floors, these were probably installed in this phase, resulting also in the truncation of any earlier floor surfaces. The only positive evidence for later activity comes from the blocking of the passage [1733]. The whole passage was blocked off with a stone wall [1731] on turf bedding [1754] and the passage infilled with turf and stone rubble [1734]. The dating of this blocking is uncertain but must have happened before 1784 as no such passage is depicted on that plan; indeed, no obvious passage occurs on the earlier historic plan from 1745/6, though the drawing is more ambiguous as it shows the butter store right up against the south wall of the refectory. Based on the inventory descriptions, it would seem more likely that access from the refectory to these chambers remained into the mid 1760s at least. No dateable finds were associated with any phases of the passage.  Upon abandonment, the walls/roof of the building had collapsed into the structure ([1388]/[1480], [1394]). 18th century finds were associated with this collapse. As with the adjacent buildings to the west, the building had subsequently been used as a dumping ground for peat ash ([1362], [1321], [1308]; see Structure XVIII, S18.8). Part of its northern wall had been heavily robbed [682], while part of the south wall [1306] appears to have fallen in en masse – but after the ruin had already been used as a peatash dump for some time.",School Refectory,stórastofan,
88,S20.6,1790,1790,,"Above these primary floors and sealing the drain capstones was a clean silt/turf levelling layer [0069] 0.3m thick. Over this sub-floor levelling deposit lay a series of secondary, organically rich floor layers grouped as [059]. An iron pan layer [054] formed at the interface between the top surface of these floors and the overlying levelling deposit. Dating from these layers is similar to the previous one with a TPQ of 1700.   A micromorphology sample (s.4) was taken across all of these deposits for thin-sectioning and analysis from which about 10 different layers were identified. At the bottom of the thin section there are two layers of natural soil which represent the turf levelling layer [069]. On top of them was a thin dark brown floor lens rich in charcoal and bone fragments. The lens does not show significant trampling and most likely accumulated in an area without much traffic/trampling taking place. Above this virgin floor there are six to eight very thin dark brown to black lenses of floor with massive to subangular blocky and/or platy structures due to heavy trampling. The lenses are rich in silt sized charcoal and bone fragments. Slithers of horse hair and possible fragments of feathers were also identified. All the floor lenses are heavily truncated from left to right most likely by a single cleaning event. All these floor layers belong to [059]. Above the floor layers there is a thick massive layer of brown silt loam which can possibly be split into three lenses of turf. No evidence of trampling or large accumulations of charcoal/ash at boundaries, only rare charcoal fragments within the layers mostly < 1 mm. They could be interpreted as two or three layers of „clean turf“ layed down in a low activity area. At the top of the thin sections there are two lenses of reddish brown and brown „clean“ turf, possibly also laid down in low activity areas within the room. These could also be turf collapse. All of these turf layers relate to the abandonment infill layer [037] discussed in the next phase.  The 1784 plan shows the building with doors at each end; here it is labelled as the schoolroom (skólinn), which could either be an error or the rooms did switch functions. Off the southeastern corner is a small chamber labelled as the assistant teachers house (Conrectors hús). This must have been built after 1764 but before 1778 when it is mentioned in a letter about a possible location for a proposed infirmary. No trace of this structure was located and it is possible that it was built up at a higher level and/or has been truncated completely by the hay barn and silo constructed in the early 20th century. The 1785 report on the earthquake damage describes the building as seriously damaged and unusable.  The final phase of the structure is ambiguous but probably represents its abandonment; a deposit of turf and stone [037] lay within and over the walls and is probably structural collapse; however, it was covered by a small patch of floor-like material [029], rich in finds with a TPQ of  1740/1750. Either this is redposited from the cutting of the haybarn, or it represents remnants of a disturbed, but still broadly in situ floor. Above this was the general site-wide levelling layer and topsoil [001]. ",School Dormitory,skólaskáli,
89,S21.5,1790,1790,,"This phase sees some final modifications to the building, chiefly in regard to its heating system. The old fireplace was deliberately blocked in; the infilling comprised unstructured rubble [493] with a more carefully constructed face [136/482] made flush with the walls of the room. Mixed over the top of this infilling and blocking was redposited hearth material ([125/475]). Replacing it was a possible iron stove located at the southern end of the room. Here lay a stone-lined pit [840]; it was rectangular, 0.7m east-west and 0.3m north-south, and c. 0.25m deep, with stone and turf courses at the top and raised above the cut. Large stone flags were tipping into it which had probably once covered it. However, no fuel residues were found in the box which might cast some doubt on this interpretation.   Running north from this pit and east of the midline/off-centre of the building was a linear channel [154], 7.6m long,  c. 0.2m wide and 0.1-0.15m deep. Covering the channel was a line of stone flags ([132]/[833]), set on turf strips either side of the channel. This was built over/cut into the turf sub-floor levelling layer [149] covering the whole room.There is little doubt this feature could not have functioned as a drain – the conduit would have been water permeable, the fill [142] inside was simply clean turf/earth and not at all characteristic of a waterlain deposit, and any water which could have run through the conduit would simply have collected in the box at the end. During the excavation, the feature was speculatively interpreted as an under-floor heating system, the slope of the ground used not to carry water down as in a drain, but hot air up as in a flue, assuming the box at the southern end was the source of the heat via an iron stove. A similarly constructed conduit was excavated at Reykholt but associated with the hot pool and dated much earlier, to the 12th-14th century.  However, it is also possible that the flagstones mark a walkway through the middle of the room, the ‚channel‘ beneath, being simply an erosion face. On the other hand, it is assumed the building still had wooden floors as there was no sign any floor material which would make the flagstones odd as a walkway; alternatively they could have acted as a plate for a midline floor joist across which floorboards were laid though the terminal box feature and the slightly skew orientation makes this interpretation rather implausible.  The 1784 plan depicts the building with a door at the western wall; however it is labelled as the dormitory (skólaskáli); either the rooms switch function or, more likely, this is a transcription error. The report on earthquake damages from 1785 mentions that the building is in a usable condition but one window is missing and panes from many of the other windows are cracked or missing.  Infilling the building was disturbed turf wall collapse ([094], [088], [085], [760]).  Above this was more disturbed collapse and walls associated with a late nineteenth century structure (see S33). Outside the structure, on the eastern side, were some turf and stone deposits ([515], [549], [573]), mostly truncated by the cut for the byre (Structure I) which may represent collapse from the eastern wall. No dating was associated with them.",School Room,skóli,
90,S4.4,1800,1840,,"In this phase the structure underwent a clear internal re-organization of its space; the original three roomed chamber was changed into just two rooms. This must have occurred prior to 1836, when a plan from this date shows such a configuration and in fact probably occurred soon after the earthquake of 1784. The separation between the two rooms is marked by a noticeable change in the floor composition and remains of a probable wooden sill beam (in floor [238] of the eastern part). The eastern room [825] had a floor of decomposed organic material [093/238] including hay, twigs and wood chips in three major lenses over some partial turf levelling ([357], [426]). The western room [826] had more extensive turf levelling [425] covered by an ash floor [306]/[307]. The drain [499] running through the centre of the structure appears to have been covered by these floors and had become more or less defunct. Based on the 1836 map, the eastern room is marked as a pantry and the western room as a kitchen. The kitchen had a fireplace in the northeastern corner; some stones associated with [306] could mark its location but this is only speculative. No upper storey is shown on the 1836 plan which suggests it must have gone by this point. All the dateable finds from this phase come from the latter half of the 18th century with a TPQ of 1740/1750; these are likely to be residual.",Pantry/Kitchen,búr/eldhús,t
91,S5.5,1800,1830,,"Sometime in the early 19th century it was likely that the original access onto the corridor (Structure VII) at the western end was re-opened. Fresh deposits of turf ([572], [772], [773]; also [521], [537]) seem to mark this event and may even indicate a solid turf wall; these layers give a TPQ of c.1800. Certainly the floor stops much further to the east than earlier suggesting the building was shortened to c. 10m. At the same time, the passage/door way [505] on the south wall was blocked off ([332]/[478]). It is possible drain [264] had gone out of use at this time or least stopped functioning efficiently. The internal arrangement of the building was also probably altered; there was a clear distinction between the eastern end and the west. The western area [908] was levelled with turf ([248] [252], [257], [323]) and then laid with flagstones ([176], [167]) while the eastern end [912] had a thick accumulation of organic matter/dung [083]. The latter could simply indicate a turf levelling layer over which wooden floors may have been laid. There is no archival information on the use of the rooms for this period, but the previous functions may have continued, i.e. pantry to the west and study/library to the east. Finds from the flagstones gave a TPQ of 1820. Ash deposits ([68], [244], [298]) had been deposited over the flagstones along the southern and eastern edges of room [908].",Pantry/Study & Library,búr/daglegtsetukamers & bókakamers,t
92,S6.3,1800,1890,,"Sometime at the turn of the century, the structure underwent major modifications, probably in the wake of the earthquake damage. On the 1836 plan, a long passage connected a small chamber labelled as the miller’s workshop to the corridor, implying most of the former structure VI was now infilled with wall material. Above this room was a loft (aligned north-south) which ran double the length of the room below (i.e. across the northern wall). It was fitted with eight beds, four on each side with access via stairs/ladder at the northwest corner of the ground floor room. The archaeological remains of this phase probably incorporate more than one period of building activity but they are too fragmentary to disentangle. In general though, the use of the structure now seems confined to just the small room [2214]. The drain [1198] was infilled with turf [1173] along the east-west section (a TPQ from this fill gave a date of c. 1840) while the base of a substantial turf/earth wall [1161] seems to have been built infilling most of the eastern room [949] except for a narrow strip along the south side. This strip, c.1.2m wide  – presumably the passage – was covered in distinctly different turf levelling layer [1921]. A TPQ from the wall infill gave a date of c. 1830. The main southern wall of the structure was re-built ([1918]). The wall (and its predecessor) has clearly been disturbed ([1705]/[1758]) by subsequent levelling of the area. In addition, a new stone and turf/earthen wall ([2233]/[2112]/[2134]/[2145]) was constructed along the western end of the south side. All of these walls were badly disturbed. There was however still a gap between the two new southern walls, creating a space for a small room, c.2.6m wide and 4.5m deep. The interior of the room was laid with turf levelling and flagstones [1353] over which lay an ash floor [1336]. The TPQ from this floor returned a date of c. 1700/1710 but most of this material must be residual.   Almost nothing survives of the western part of this building but the 1836 plan shows a garden occupying this area; nothing of this was identified. However, along the front of the structure, i.e along the south side, was raised pavement marked by a turf platform and kerbstones [1670]/[1672], [1902]), separating the structure from the yard to the south. It probably represents a repair/re-build of the earlier kerb [2040]  and seems to have been stepped. Its western extent is uncertain but may have been truncated. A small ash dump [1908] lay over this.  The abandonment of the structure is marked by collapse structural deposits [1344] infilling the chamber. A number of layers of disorganized structural material (turf and stone, sometimes mixed with ash) clustered outside and around the western end ([2245], [2253], [2282], [2284], [2302]) and southern side of the structure ([1647], [1760], [2248], [2275], [2283], [2286]). These probably represent remains of the walls from both earlier and later phases, as a lot of earlier finds are incorporated into their matrix. However, depositionally, they belong to the final abandonment of the structure. No further structures appear to have been built on this location. ",Bishops Living Quarters,Biskups baðstofa,t
93,S7.3,1800,1840,,"The corridor continued in use into the 19th century without much modification, although the upper deposits are much more disturbed. An upper drain fill [1226]/[1406] of the main drain [1287] was sealed by disturbed/collapsed drain stones ([1203]/[1565]), the fill of which gave a TPQ of c. 1830. All the drains in the adjacent rooms seem to have gone out of use early in the 19th century and the same probably applies here; if the drain was still in use, it functioned poorly and was probably never cleaned out and probably became defunct during this phase. Associated with this were a series of disturbed floor deposits of flagstones and ash ([1181], [1158], [1172], [1176], [1192], [1239], [1246]) which all had 19th century finds, one of which returned a TPQ of c. 1840. Turf and flagstone floor deposits ([1255], [1548], [1555]) at the entrance to the corridor returned a similar TPQ of 1830. A fairly extensive layer of flagstones and turf levelling mixed with ash ([1035], [1052], [992], [1402], [1384]/[1385], [1444], [1445]) covered almost the full length of the corridor and gave a TPQ of c. 1840. These seal the sill stones [1452] associated with Structure III.  The 1836 plan shows a single, undivided corridor as in the 1784 plan.",Vestibule & Corridor,göng,t
94,S8.3,1800,1850,,"The last phase of activity in this structure is almost all confined to the central aisle [1227]. The doorway into the main axial corridor was sealed with a blocking wall [465], which returned a TPQ of 1767 and the western wall was re-built completely and set back by c. 1m at the northern end making the room much wider here, to c. 4.1 m wide. At the south end, the structure appears to have been the same width, making the shape of the building slightly trapezoidal. In the centre of the aisle, along its south side, a small pit [324] was dug. The cut [326] was very shallow at only 0.2m deep, but 0.7m wide and 0.95m long with a narrower extension of c. 0.5m at the southeast side. It had a small, narrow projection at the south-eastern corner. No traces of lining or original fill of the pit was identified, but it was possibly some kind of dug-down box or root cellar, perhaps for storing vegetables (e.g. potatoes). The pit was backfilled with mixed soil [325]. Some layers of turf levelling ([77]/[237], [303], [305], [341]) had been laid on the floor and a narrow deposit of peatash [310] survived along the north side of the aisle, most of it truncated by an excavation trench from the 1980s. The finds from these layers are generally late 18th century, but include early 19th century material as well, especially in the backfill of the pit. Based on the plan from 1784 which shows a passage still entering the main axial corridor to the east, this phase must post-date that; moreover there is some resemblance to a set of outhouses depicted on the 1836 map, which shows a similar, three-roomed structure in an enclosed garden area. It is not known where the entrance to this structure may have been at this time, but if there was a gable at the south, possibly there could have been a door there, although a painting by Mayer from 1836 appears to show this building with the door still in the western wall. If there was a door here, it must have involved a step up out of the building as the surviving lower course of stones on the western wall is continuous. This is not entirely implausible as the demolition of structure IX to the west will have raised the ground level outside the house.   The abandonment of the building is marked by multiple, disorganized turf and stone deposits representing the collapse/demolition of walls and roof. The surface of structure was overlain by sections of the west wall collapsing inward ([66]/[270]) and then an upper deposit of more structural debris both in the building ([49]/[269]) and over the east wall [463]. These collapse layers had a lot of 18th century finds, but a TPQ from the wall collapse gave a date of c. 1820. If this structure is indeed that shown on the 1837 plan, its abandonment probably dates to the mid (or even later) 19th century.",Nursery/Private Chambers,barnhús/prestakamers,t
95,S9.2,1800,1880,,"There are only very ephemeral traces of this structure surviving and they was not even properly identified in the field as remains of a building but only later during post-excavation analysis of the records. Only parts of the northern end and middle remain; all traces of the southern end seem to have been completely erased by subsequent levelling. What remains of the building is defined by a section of the northern wall ([381], [403]). Of these two sections, wall fragment [381] is probably a later rebuild, blocking a probable passage [505] connecting this structure with Structure V to the north (see Structure V, S5.3). Beneath wall [381] were a series of mixed turf and stone deposits ([1299]: [370], [1407], [1413]) which may represent debris from remodelling of this north wall. A TPQ of 1775 was associated with the earliest of these layers, which went beneath [381], dated to c. 1800.  The width of the structure is hard to ascertain as there seem to be multiple phases including a possible shifting of the eastern wall; an estimate would suggest it was probably originally c. 3.2m wide and c. 8.3m long, comparable to the adjacent structure VIII. A wide passage connects the two structures, defined by a disturbed flagstone floor [309], which was flanked by a turf and stone wall to the south [378]. A TPQ for this flagstone floor returned a date of 1739. The northern side is unclear; smaller flagstones forming a paving surface ([274]/[1459]) lay north of the main passage floor, separated by turf deposit [287]. These may be an earlier/ later section of the passage, indicating it size or position had changed. The passage continues west for 8m, although its middle section has all been truncated. The western end of the passage and the northern chamber were similarly covered in flagstones over turf levelling [175], which were associated with a TPQ of 1753. Traces of earlier floors ([240], [260], [275]) in the northern half survived, but only close to the wall; a TPQ of c.1750 was associated with one of these deposits. The stones in the earlier floor suggest the structure might originally have been on a slightly different alignment.  This structure is the new house mentioned in the 1744 inventory which was built over the Miðbadstofa (Structure XI). It was divided into two rooms, both with wooden panelling and floors and a separate stairway to an upper level, which was also divided into two rooms. Each room had a lockable door, a new one for the south room and an older/re-used door for the northern chamber. Overall it was eight bays long and had nine glass windows. In each of the two rooms downstairs was a bed, with a round table in the south room and a square table in north room. There was one bed upstairs. It is described as all well made and new. There was a door ready for the south room in the loft but not yet installed. In 1747, the house is similar but now has a chimney and oven and with shutters added to four of the windows. In 1759, it seems to have lost one bay as it is now only seven bays long, but is otherwise the same except for an extra bed in the loft. It is starting to look worn. In 1764, the building is being called the New House (Nya Husid) despite now being over twenty years old. There are no substantial changes except the loft now had five beds, presumably the beds in the downstairs rooms having now been moved upstairs. The aisle between the two rooms also now seems to have a loft over it with a bed and locked door. One addition however is the construction of a passage linking this building to the Dining Room in the Bishop‘s wing (Structure V).  On the 1784 plan, this building is depicted as parallel to adjacent Structure VIII, where there is a single, joint corridor running through the middle of both buildings; this connection probably happened after 1764 as no mention is made of a connection between these buildings in the 1764 inventory where the buildings also occur in very different places in the order of description. Moreover, no passage exists connecting this and Structure V on the 1784 map, suggesting this passage had been removed by this time. The building does not seem to have been severely damaged by the 1784 earthquake, and no mention of it occurs in the 1784 report but in one from 1785 it is is described as being in usable condition. Significantly in the 1785 report, the building (called the Miðbaðstofa) is described immediately after the Nursery (Barnhusid), implying their connection. The abandonment of the building is marked by several, widely spread demolition layers ([166], [177], [236], [246], [294], [392]) which have probably also been mixed by later levelling. A small patch of peatash [375] lies under one of these layers and probably is associated with the 19th century farm. It is possible – based on the 1837 plan – that the southern part of this structure was re-built as an outhouse, but since nothing of this section survives it must remain only an educated guess.",Living Quarters,Miðbaðdstofa,
96,S10.4,1800,1880,,"The walls and interior dimensions of the building remained the same, although some repairs occurred along the northern face of the north wall ([1437], [1254], [1454]/[1715], [1890], [1931], [2105], [2110]). What is probably repair debris was excavated along the external north face of the wall ([1936], [1942], [1947], [1924], [1920], [1964], [1965]). A TPQ of 1730/40 was associated with this debris. The main changes involved re-surfacing the floor and re-building the drain. On the eastern side of the structure, the whole floor and eastern drain were sealed with a turf layer [1688] while over that lay an accumulated deposit of turf mixed with charcoal and peatash [1535]. On the western side of the structure, a more confined turf patch layer [1828] sealed the western arm of the drain while a more extensive turf layer with some mixed charocal [1546] covered the earlier floor. Scattered flagstones occurred in the floors, most extensively at the western side close to the wall. The TPQ from these floors gave dates of 1758/1760. The central section of the original drain was cleaned [1166] and completely re-built ([1500]. The sidestones (1165/2244], [2043]) were re-set or repaired within the old cut and filled by primary drain silts [1213] (which we excavated in segments). A TPQ of 1767 was associated with this primary drain fill, but it appears as if the drain was soon after laid with a flagstone base [1189], over which further fills accumulated (secondary: [1179]/[1952]; tertiary: [1164]/[1951]. The TPQ from these secondary deposits returned a date of c. 1800. The only other feature in the building was a small, shallow bowl-shaped pit [1537] marked by a circular cut [1539] 60cm in diameter and 12cm deep set dead centre in the eastern side of the building. Inside was a fill [1538] of floor material. Given the profile of the pit, it is unlikely to be a barrel pit – it may simply mark the removal of a large stone or even a stone feature such as an oven.  There is no mention of the kitchen in the 1764, but many other buildings are also omitted for some reason. It is however listed in the damages to buildings after the earthquake of 1784 where is it described as having fallen down and the chimney being cracked. The plan from 1784 shows the building with an entrance placed centrally on the north side, although no chimneys/ovens are marked in.  The abandonment of the building is marked by several collapse/demolition deposits from the walls/roof, most of them extending north of the building ([1839], [1485], [1465], [1466], [1247], [1241], [2115], [1207], [621], [586], [576], [347/614], [289], [282]), though some lay over the north wall itself ([1127], [1128], [1129], [1118], and some were extensively spread north of the structure ([1443/623], [1486]). A TPQ from these latter deposits returned a date of c. 1870, while a TPQ of 1820/1830 was associated with the deposits closer to the north wall. These numerous deposits of structural debris probably represent a long-term process of weathering and possibly even traces other building activities no longer visible. Some other turf layers extended over the eastern end of the building ([1108], [1104], [172]), but at the western end the ground had been levelled to just above the floor level from the previous phase. It is likely that a lot of material has been truncated over this structure – possibly even a later phase of the building. The 1837 plan shows an outhouse which could be in this location, but no evidence of any 19th century features survived except perhaps a short segment of wall [1889]. The only indication of activity was some early 19th century material in the abandonment deposits infilling the top of the drain ([1159]/[1501], [1150]), which gave a TPQ of c. 1800.",Kitchen,Eldhús,
97,S13.3,1800,1830,,"In the last phase of use of this corridor a well-constructed blocking wall [554], stone faced on both sides, was constructed two-thirds down the corrider, just north of the entrance into Structure VIII. This effectively divided the corridor into two sections, a northern side [30] and southern side [315]. Given that no such blocking is depicted on the 1784 map, it most likely post-dates this. No good dating was associated with this wall, just a broadly 18th century date. It is unclear if the northern section of the corridor was even roofed at this point but possibly not; within was a layer of what is probably collpased roof stone or debris from robbing the flagstone floor ([646], [608], [446], [158]) with a TPQ of 1767, and was sealed by a dark organic layer composed primarily of hay [148]. It is possible the corridor was used to store hay or even for silage. A photograph taken over a century later in 1924 seems to show a linear haystack capped with turf (a common practice); but what is uncanny is that it seems to lie along the route of this corridor. It is possible this space was used over a long period to store hay.    No comparable layers were identified on the southern side [315] of the blocking wall, rather  there were a series of turf debris dumps ([479], [449], [321], [320], [314], [299], [296], [259], [258], [251], [250]) and some peatash layers ([304], [313], [327], [355], [606]). These are broadly contemporary with the blocking wall [454] inserted in the final occupation phase of Structure VIII (S8.3); they are also contemporary with similar dumps which are continuous across Structures  XVII and XVIII (see phases S17.8 and S18.8; [1304], [1316], [1321], [1322]), but where peatash was far more predominant.",Main Corridor,Göng,t
98,S14.2,1800,1800,,"The passage [1269] into the cathedral was largely excavated by Kristján Eldjárn in the 1950s where two phases were identified, an earlier dated to the mid-15th century and a later one from the mid 17th century. The earlier one was associated with a drain, though Eldjárn thought the drain could still have functioned while the upper phase floor was in use. A section of the southern end of the passage survived beneath the modern reconstruction but it is somewhat unclear how this relates to Eldjárn‘s two phases. In terms of elevation and the presence of the drain, it would seem to relate to his earlier phase floor (i.e. Gólf II). However, this raises questions over Eldjárn‘s dating of the earlier phase excavated in the 1950s. Indeed, the recovery of clay pipes and vessel glass from the earlier phase might suggest that both phases of the passage Eldjárn excavated date after the 1600s. On the other hand, his later phase clearly has the schoolmasters room coming off its western side (see Structure XXX) and this structure we have dated to c. 1670-1750 which fits well with Eldjárn‘s dating for his later, upper phase. The best explanation we can offer here is that there must have been some steps down from the end of the long passage as it entered the school, accounting for the difference in elevation. The drain may still have linked up with Eldjárn‘s earlier phase as Eldjárn coinsidered the drain could well have functioned into the later phase while the 17th century finds associated with the earlier phase could simply relate to the final phase of activity.  What survived in our excavations consisted of a section of the western wall [1099/1080] and parts of a flagstone floor/capping [1149] over a drain [1280], composed of sidestones [1153] and fill [1151]. The drain would have probably turned to join the drain [1117] in passage [106], which in turn fed into the main drain of the corridor [751] (see Structure XIII). Most of this passage, as it survived within our excavation area, had been truncated by the haybarn (Structure II). No dating came from any of these layers. In terms of elevation though, it is probably contemporary with the re-building of the main axial corridor and the re-building of the school dormitory from the mid 18th century.  In the 1674 inventory, this is probably the ‚inner‘ passage to the school dormitory which is described as two bays long; it adjoins the under-passage to the church which was excavated in the 1950s. It gets only passing mention in subsequent inventories none of which add any information.  Over the floor and wall of the passage were various disturbed layers ([135], [1069], [1073], [1074], [1121]), associated with finds dated to the second half of the 18th century.",Corridor to Church,undirgöng,
99,S15.3,1800,1850,,"In the later phase, the room was drastically remodelled by reducing its size in half. The southern vat was taken apart and the hole filled with demolition deposits and turf. At the base of the southern vat, there appeared to be a trampled surface consisting of turf [1037] and ashes [1028] sealed by mixed turf and clay [1024], all of which are probably demolition deposits. Several layers of collapsed clay lining and turf infill was then used to seal off the southern cell ([1002], [980], [970], [937], [943], [916]). The northern vat also appears to have been dismantled and re-built; over demolition layers ([1061], [1055]) at the base of the original vat, a new cutting was made [852] c. 2m by 2m, cut down to a depth of c. 0.5m below the floor/base of walls and lined with timber panelling ([820]/[821]) and blue clay [819]. The floor beneath the vat was cobbled/flagged [875].  Associated with the re-modelling were new walls ([855]/[889]/[1124]) around three sides. The sides of the walls are leaning in, especially on the north and western sides suggesting they have been subsequently disturbed, which may also be related to the lack of stones on the northern edge if they had been robbed. Along the southern, eastern and western sides, there were also remains of a ledge or packing ([862]/[851]/[849]) between the sides of the vat and the cut. Essentially, the room was one large vat or tank, made water-tight by the clay and timber and would have been filled with whey which would have been scooped up with a bucket from the passage end. Access to the room, as before, was through a narrow passage [1270], which had a new flagstone floor [714] laid. A wooden beam may mark the location of a threshold/door jamb.  As in the previous phase, closely dateable finds were more or less absent. When this re-modelling occurred is therefore hard to say, as the documentary sources are fragmentary. It clearly post-dates 1759, which is the last description we have of the two-vat building. Certainly on the 1784 plan, only one (northern) vat is shown, which again matches the archaeological data for this phase. In the 1785 report on the condition of buildings after the earthquake it is assessed as being in good condition so presumably did not suffer much.  At the end of its life, the vat was probably taken apart and most of the wood re-used; infilling the room were a series of abandonment deposits: collapsed clay lining [815] sealed by wall/roof collapse [662]. In the passage [1270], a layer of turf [670] also sealed the floor, over a stone blocking [654] was constructed sealing the room off at the entrance from the main corridor into passage [1270]. A Sealing this were a series of layers of turf collapse that filled both the room and passage ([618]/[582]). TPQ from the primary dismantling of the vat gave a date of c. 1800. The uppermost layers of structural material infilling the room are more mixed and disturbed, probably during 19th century activities. These deposits ([506], [535], [534], [487], [495]) had a TPQ of c. 1850.",Wheystore,sýruklefi,
100,S16.2,1800,1800,,"This was a badly preserved room, which has been truncated heavily on its southern half. Only its northern wall and the corner of the eastern wall [2761] survives as well as the northern part of the western wall it shares with the corridor. Its eastern and western walls at least appear to have been c. 1.2m thick. The building is 3.7m wide and the northern half, 2m deep; how far the room extended southward is difficult to say. The 1784 plan shows a room of equal size either side of the door, which would make its southern wall almost overlap the northern wall of the refectory (see Structure XIX; [690]), but there is just enough space to squeeze this structure in if the southern side was slightly shallower.  If so, it would make the building originally c. 4m long. There is a substantial step marked by a turf layer ([661]/[655]) at the entrance and it is possible there would have been a wooden ladder/steps here as there is a height difference of c. 0.25m between this step and the floor of the building. In other words, the floor of this room was much higher than the floor of the main axial corridor. Inside the structure, there were remains of a partially flagged floor [649] in the northwestern corner. There were few dateable finds from the building, some glass vessels returned a TPQ of c. 1650 from the floor, but the building is certainly much later.   This structure is not mentioned in any of the inventories, nor the reports on earthquake damage and nor on the 1745/6 drawing; its only documented existence is from the 1784 map where it is labelled as a store room (geymsluhús/skemma). It is probable it was built around the same time or soon after the wheystore (Structure XV) was reduced in size – although the dating of this is also uncertain. A very approximate date in the third quarter of the 18th century as been assigned to this building.  Upon abandonment, there were only a few patches of turf collapse ([645], [641], [396]) sealing the floor before the ruin was used to dump peatash (see Midden Area B). No close dating is associated with the abandonment of the structure but since it is depicted on the 1784 map, it must post-date then.",Storage Room,geymsluhús/skemma,

Most of what remained consisted of demolition deposits from the earlier phase. These demolition deposits ([41/43], [508], [611]) sealed the floors from the previous phase. Further demolition/collapse deposits lay over the south wall ([434], [486],) and others ([344/863], [896], [1435]) extended southwest from the building and may relate to a later construction/demolition phase as they appear to be sealed by terminal yard surfaces (see Courtyard, C.4). A TPQ of 1872 was associated with one of these dumps, but all have finds which date after the mid-nineteenth century.  A plan of this structure from 1836 shows a small, single room marked as a workshop and flour mill (hand-ground); it had a long narrow passage leading from it to the corridor. Above it aligned east-west was a loft fitted with seven beds arranged around three sides of the room; access was via some steps/ladder at the southwest corner of the ground floor room. It cannot be known if this loft is essentially the same as that constructed originally in the 1720s or whether it has been completely re-built; given the major structural changes seen on the ground floor the latter is more likely. Based on this, one should probably assume that the eastern room [912] continued in use while the western room was infilled except for a narrow passage following the line of the former drain [264]. However, no archaeological evidence of this was found, probably because it had been completely demolished by later levelling. Certainly there were no finds post-dating the mid-19th century associated with this structure and from documentary sources, the area does not seem to have been built on again afterwards.",Workshop/Flour Mill,vinnustofa/mölunarhús,
105,S13.4,1830,1850,,"Sometime in the early nineteenth century the northern entrance to the corridor was deliberately sealed off with a blocking wall ([110]/[146]) which only had one stone face (outer). In the northern section of the corridor [30] and above the hay layer and abutting the blocking wall were multiple turf debris deposits ([051], [072], [076], [089], [091], [119], [120], [129], [131], [133], [134], [138], [140], [144], [147], [150], [151], [155], [156]) interspersed with two major peat ash dumps, a smaller one [141] against the western side and a more substantial spread [079] infilling a section of the ruin at the northern end. Some of the turf collapse however contained lenses of peat ash ([119], [091] and [076]). Another dump of peatash [1307] lay over the western wall of the corridor. The peat-ash dumps suggests the ruin was sporadically used to dump hearth waste during the first decades of the 19th century. The turf debris could represent either continual in situ weathering/collapse of the ruin or deliberate dumping of structural waste from demolition/repairs. Dating from the layers generally tended to be 18th century which may suggest the former (i.e. in situ weathering), and only two (of the uppermost) layers had later nineteenth century finds. Signs of possible stone robbing from a section of the corridor wall were also seen [746].  A map from 1836 does not depict the ruin of the corridor but rather garden beds and open land on the area where the corridor would be. However it is likely there would have been a hollow marking the line of the ruin; a description from 1865 mentions a hollow which is thought to be the subterranean passage to the church (see Structure XIV below), though it could also have been this corridor.",Silo/Midden,öskuhaugur,
106,C.3,1830,1850,,"In the 19th century the drain [1077] was re-built, comprised of a cut [1932], side stones [1564], capstones [1559] and an upper [1683] and lower fill [1741]. The top part of the drain had been disturbed in a middle section ([1645]) and the capstones only survived in situ at the northern end. The fills of the drain were also excavated in 1m segments to control for finds recovery. Dating from material in the sidestones of drain gave a TPQ of 1820 indicating a construction date probably in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. A TPQ of 1820/1830 came from the primary fill, while the upper fill returned a TPQ of c. 1850. The drain largely followed the line of the original drain and may indeed have been mostly a repair rather than a re-build. The main alteration was a shift in the location of the bend of the drain c. 0.4m to the west and north so it is possible that some of the more northern and western sections of this drain actually date to the original construction; certainly some finds date to the 18th century though these could be redeposited.  Associated with this repair/alteration to the drain was a re-surfacing of the yard, at least partially; large, well-laid flagstones [1592] remained in situ at the north end around the entrance to the farmhouse, associated with a TPQ of c. 1850. It is possible similar flagstones extended over the rest of the yard but were robbed, or equally likely, only the area by the entrance was considered important enough to surface with proper flagstones. The area is depicted on both the 1836 plan and on sketches by Auguste Mayer from the same year from the same period which shows a laid, flagstone surface. Along the south side of Structure VI, these flagstones abut/respect a kerb ([1556]/[1588], [1670], [1672], [1902]) which forms the edge of a pavement in front of the building.

The south wall may also have been re-built at this time [856]. Very little remains of the structure in this phase, which has been severely damaged by later levelling; only the eastern end survives intact. The building was possibly still divided into two rooms. The eastern room [825] which is all that survived, had an extensive flagstone floor ([087/178/234]) which extended for c. 3m, with accumulating organic matter primarily of decomposed animal dung ([065/184]) and ash lenses ([060/061], [062], [057/171]).

110,S29.2,1840,1900,,"In a secondary phase to this building, the northern timber screen wall was re-built with turf/earth and stone as the passage [106] went out of use and was infilled (see Structure XIII, S13.3/4). The new northern wall [111] consisted of coarse stone facing with a turf/earth fill, the stones of which may have derived from robbing [1106] of the drain [1117] in the passage [106]. The building otherwise kept its southern timber gable, east and west walls, and its internal dimensions. The interior floor of the structure was now stone paved [098], including some very large, flat flagstones marking an external paving in front of the building. A TPQ of c.1750 was associated with this paving but the building is clearly much later. It is unclear when this phase starts but it seems possible that this structure represents a re-build after a hiatus; no structure is shown in this location on the 1836 map suggesting the former infirmary had been abandoned by then but probably still visible as a ruin. The re-build in this phase may have converted this ruin into an outhouse such as a storage shed. The date of the infilling from the abandonment of this re-built structure, suggests this new building remained in use for some time into the early 19th century. These two pieces of evidence suggest that this building dates to the second half of the 19th century. This building may even be one of the ‚sheds‘ depicted on a photograph from the end of the nineteenth century.  Infilling the room and spreading out south of the building was turf collapse/debris from the walls and roof ([052], [078], [137], [472], [485], [1116]); a TPQ of 1872 was associated with ceramics from this collapse and generally the finds date to the late nineteenth century.

At the south end, the structure appears to have been the same width, making the shape of the building slightly trapezoidal.

It had a small, narrow projection at the south-eastern corner. No traces of lining or original fill of the pit was identified, but it was possibly some kind of dug-down box or root cellar, perhaps for storing vegetables (e.g. potatoes). The pit was backfilled with mixed soil [325]. Some layers of turf levelling ([77]/[237], [303], [305], [341]) had been laid on the floor and a narrow deposit of peatash [310] survived along the north side of the aisle, most of it truncated by an excavation trench from the 1980s. The finds from these layers are generally late 18th century, but include early 19th century material as well, especially in the backfill of the pit. Based on the plan from 1784 which shows a passage still entering the main axial corridor to the east, this phase must post-date that; moreover there is some resemblance to a set of outhouses depicted on the 1836 map, which shows a similar, three-roomed structure in an enclosed garden area. It is not known where the entrance to this structure may have been at this time, but if there was a gable at the south, possibly there could have been a door there, although a painting by Mayer from 1836 appears to show this building with the door still in the western wall. If there was a door here, it must have involved a step up out of the building as the surviving lower course of stones on the western wall is continuous. This is not entirely implausible as the demolition of structure IX to the west will have raised the ground level outside the house.   The abandonment of the building is marked by multiple, disorganized turf and stone deposits representing the collapse/demolition of walls and roof. The surface of structure was overlain by sections of the west wall collapsing inward ([66]/[270]) and then an upper deposit of more structural debris both in the building ([49]/[269]) and over the east wall [463]. These collapse layers had a lot of 18th century finds, but a TPQ from the wall collapse gave a date of c. 1820. If this structure is indeed that shown on the 1837 plan, its abandonment probably dates to the mid (or even later) 19th century.",Nursery/Private Chambers,barnhús/prestakamers,
112,S15.4,1850,1850,,"In the later phase, the room was drastically remodelled by reducing its size in half. The southern vat was taken apart and the hole filled with demolition deposits and turf. At the base of the southern vat, there appeared to be a trampled surface consisting of turf [1037] and ashes [1028] sealed by mixed turf and clay [1024], all of which are probably demolition deposits. Several layers of collapsed clay lining and turf infill was then used to seal off the southern cell ([1002], [980], [970], [937], [943], [916]). The northern vat also appears to have been dismantled and re-built; over demolition layers ([1061], [1055]) at the base of the original vat, a new cutting was made [852] c. 2m by 2m, cut down to a depth of c. 0.5m below the floor/base of walls and lined with timber panelling ([820]/[821]) and blue clay [819]. The floor beneath the vat was cobbled/flagged [875].  Associated with the re-modelling were new walls ([855]/[889]/[1124]) around three sides. The sides of the walls are leaning in, especially on the north and western sides suggesting they have been subsequently disturbed, which may also be related to the lack of stones on the northern edge if they had been robbed. Along the southern, eastern and western sides, there were also remains of a ledge or packing ([862]/[851]/[849]) between the sides of the vat and the cut. Essentially, the room was one large vat or tank, made water-tight by the clay and timber and would have been filled with whey which would have been scooped up with a bucket from the passage end. Access to the room, as before, was through a narrow passage [1270], which had a new flagstone floor [714] laid. A wooden beam may mark the location of a threshold/door jamb.  As in the previous phase, closely dateable finds were more or less absent. When this re-modelling occurred is therefore hard to say, as the documentary sources are fragmentary. It clearly post-dates 1759, which is the last description we have of the two-vat building. Certainly on the 1784 plan, only one (northern) vat is shown, which again matches the archaeological data for this phase. In the 1785 report on the condition of buildings after the earthquake it is assessed as being in good condition so presumably did not suffer much.  At the end of its life, the vat was probably taken apart and most of the wood re-used; infilling the room were a series of abandonment deposits: collapsed clay lining [815] sealed by wall/roof collapse [662]. In the passage [1270], a layer of turf [670] also sealed the floor, over a stone blocking [654] was constructed sealing the room off at the entrance from the main corridor into passage [1270]. A Sealing this were a series of layers of turf collapse that filled both the room and passage ([618]/[582]). TPQ from the primary dismantling of the vat gave a date of c. 1800. The uppermost layers of structural material infilling the room are more mixed and disturbed, probably during 19th century activities. These deposits ([506], [535], [534], [487], [495]) had a TPQ of c. 1850.",Wheystore,sýruklefi,

Associated with this wall fragment are a series of almost pure charcoal dumps with some smithying waste ([038/182], [042/189], [045], [191]), associated with a mid-late 19th century finds. These dumps have formed in the linear hollow of the former axial corridor (Structure XIII) but it is unclear if they also run through an opening/entrance to this possible forge or if they have been disturbed along with the wall.

Asscoiated with this later surface were a series of localized ash dumps occurred mixed with flagstones ([860], [907], [914], [603], [1655]), which seem to fan out around the entrance to the farmhouse, indicating they are probably rake-outs from fireplaces inside the farmhouse.

They include several layers of demolished turf and stone structural remains ([047], [050], [058]), sealed by a thick peatash dump [044], which was in turn sealed by a thick deposit of structural collapse [034]. A TPQ of 1951 from a coin was associated with the peatash layer, though it could be intrusive given how disturbed these layers were. A possible section of in situ wall [070]/[067] ran across the northern edge of these deposits. Traces of this structure seemed to continue eastward ([056], [064], [097]), sealed by collapse layers ([026], [027/063], [046/053], [074], [075], [082]) but most of these layers were very badly disturbed and contained earlier finds.  It is likely these represent the remains of various phases of activity; two turf buildings are shown on a photograph from 1898 on this location, east of a turf farmhouse, and these were replaced in the early 20th century by some stables, built with a new haybarn (Structure II) and byre (Stucture I). It seems likely these remains relate to the stables or the earlier structures. The stables were timber framed and iron-clad as with the haybarn and byre. However these stables seem to have been pulled down and replaced by or converted into a tool shed in the mid 1930s,  based on descriptions in  estate evaluations. No traces of this shed were found, which is described as having a timber frame, corrugated iron cladding and earthen floor.

The south wall may also have been re-built at this time [856]. Very little remains of the structure in this phase, which has been severely damaged by later levelling; only the eastern end survives intact. The building was possibly still divided into two rooms. The eastern room [825] which is all that survived, had an extensive flagstone floor ([087/178/234]) which extended for c. 3m, with accumulating organic matter primarily of decomposed animal dung ([065/184]) and ash lenses ([060/061], [062], [057/171]). TPQ on these floors give a date of c. 1840-1860. More compact than the earlier floors, at this time – or at least at the end of its period of use, the room may have been used to house livestock. The western room [826] was almost completely levelled, a mixed turf and ash deposit [267] probably representing its disturbed floor smeared with flattened wall material.  The abandonment of the structure is marked by a series of turf/dung deposits ([018]/[173]) and ash dumps ([014]/[169]) inside the structure, again only really surviving at the eastern end. Outside were a series of more substantial deposits of disorganized tuf and stone ([073], [086/239], [104], [105/256], [112], [121], [242]) representing collapse/demolition of the building. They sealed a flagged/cobbled surface [096/241] which is probably contemporary with the structure when it was in use. No further structures lay above this building, rather it seemed to have lay in a gap between the later farmhouses (Structures XXXV and an eastern farmhouse and stable, Structure XXIII).",Pantry/Kitchen,búr/eldhús,
120,S6.4,1890,1890,,"Sometime at the turn of the century, the structure underwent major modifications, probably in the wake of the earthquake damage. On the 1836 plan, a long passage connected a small chamber labelled as the miller’s workshop to the corridor, implying most of the former structure VI was now infilled with wall material. Above this room was a loft (aligned north-south) which ran double the length of the room below (i.e. across the northern wall). It was fitted with eight beds, four on each side with access via stairs/ladder at the northwest corner of the ground floor room. The archaeological remains of this phase probably incorporate more than one period of building activity but they are too fragmentary to disentangle. In general though, the use of the structure now seems confined to just the small room [2214]. The drain [1198] was infilled with turf [1173] along the east-west section (a TPQ from this fill gave a date of c. 1840) while the base of a substantial turf/earth wall [1161] seems to have been built infilling most of the eastern room [949] except for a narrow strip along the south side. This strip, c.1.2m wide  – presumably the passage – was covered in distinctly different turf levelling layer [1921]. A TPQ from the wall infill gave a date of c. 1830. The main southern wall of the structure was re-built ([1918]). The wall (and its predecessor) has clearly been disturbed ([1705]/[1758]) by subsequent levelling of the area. In addition, a new stone and turf/earthen wall ([2233]/[2112]/[2134]/[2145]) was constructed along the western end of the south side. All of these walls were badly disturbed. There was however still a gap between the two new southern walls, creating a space for a small room, c.2.6m wide and 4.5m deep. The interior of the room was laid with turf levelling and flagstones [1353] over which lay an ash floor [1336]. The TPQ from this floor returned a date of c. 1700/1710 but most of this material must be residual.   Almost nothing survives of the western part of this building but the 1836 plan shows a garden occupying this area; nothing of this was identified. However, along the front of the structure, i.e along the south side, was raised pavement marked by a turf platform and kerbstones [1670]/[1672], [1902]), separating the structure from the yard to the south. It probably represents a repair/re-build of the earlier kerb [2040]  and seems to have been stepped. Its western extent is uncertain but may have been truncated. A small ash dump [1908] lay over this.  The abandonment of the structure is marked by collapse structural deposits [1344] infilling the chamber. A number of layers of disorganized structural material (turf and stone, sometimes mixed with ash) clustered outside and around the western end ([2245], [2253], [2282], [2284], [2302]) and southern side of the structure ([1647], [1760], [2248], [2275], [2283], [2286]). These probably represent remains of the walls from both earlier and later phases, as a lot of earlier finds are incorporated into their matrix. However, depositionally, they belong to the final abandonment of the structure. No further structures appear to have been built on this location. ",Millers Workshop,malarakamers,

122,S35.1,1898,1958,,"The main farmhouse lies in the northwest corner of the main excavation area, and what survives is solely the cellar [1098], whose south-east corner just projects within the northern limit of excavation. It was clearly built into the ruin of and replaced Structure III. The cellar was stone-lined and cut down [1251] from the present surface at a depth of 0.6m; it had a damaged, flagstone floor [1084] over a drain which skirted the edge of the room; remains of an iron pipe was found in the drain.   with a farmhouse. This division seems to go back to the late 19th century; census data indicate the split occurred sometime in the 1870s and had disappeared again by 1930. No traces of the eastern farmhouse were ever found during the excavation but based on photographs and maps from the early twentieth century, this would have been located between the stables (Structure XXXIII) and the western farmhouse (Structure XXXV). Photographs from 1898 to 1924 show two gabled buildings which appear to be the eastern farm. The 1916-18 estate evaluation describes it as a timber house with iron cladding consisting of a living room (baðstofa) and shed alongside and a storage house next to it. The building was pulled down in the late 1920s as it does not recur in later estate evaluations. The western farmhouse was the main farm in use in the early 19th century (Structures III-VII) and was only levelled and re-built at the end of the 19th century when a new timber structure was erected. This is structire XXXV.  This house was built in 1897/8 and an inventory from 1908 records it as free-standing timber house, c.8 x 6.3 m, clad all over in corrugated iron and with a basement under the whole house which was, cemented. The house also had a brick chimney and a hipped roof. There was a cooker on the main floor which was quartered into four rooms, with three rooms in the loft. It is described as 10 years old. A photograph by the English traveller Frederick Howell dated to 1898, shows the house presumably being built in the background to the far left. Later estate evaluations describe the same building; in 1916-18 it is described as 8.16 x 6.3m with one floor but with a loft space, presumably under the hipped roof. A photograph taken between 1902 and 1905 shows the house in a better view. The house is depicted again in photographs taken by the state antiquarian Matthías Þórðarson in 1924, only now the roof has clearly been re-built into the more common pitched type. An estate evaluation from 1938 also now describes a two-storied house with a loft space and a stone cellar; the whole building is 8 x 10m and the ground floor has four rooms and a kitchen, the upper floor four bedrooms. There is a cooker, coal oven and water pipes. The house has clearly increased in size by this point and this seems to relate to an extension on the eastern side, increasing the length from 6.3 to 10m. The extension is shown on the photograph from 1902-5, suggesting it happened before the roof re-modelling. In a 1947 evaluation the house is described in two parts, the main part and the extension. The main part is only classed as one storey, 8 x6.1m with a loft and stone basement; the basement is described as little used. The main floor has a living room, two bedrooms and a kitchen, while in the loft there is a living area and two bedrooms. The extension is 4.5 x3.5m, and consisted of a living room on the main floor and two bedrooms in the in loft.  According to the 1947 evaluation, on both the west and east sides of the farmhouse were two sets of farm buildings, including both a byre and a haybarn. Those to the east were excavated (Structures I, II and XXXIII) while those to the west lay outside the excavation area. The western byre was only built in 1942 and was 9.8 x 6.4m, while the western haybarn was 9.8x9.5m and dug down by 1m. Both were timber framed, iron clad and with an asbestos roof. These western farm buildings can  be seen on photographs taken during the 1950s excavations at Skálholt.  A local from the area Guðmundur Indriðason vaguely remembered the timber farmhouse and the basement which was described as small and not used very often; it had a trapdoor and ladder to the main floor (pers.comm. to Elín Hreiðarsdóttir, 15.07.2004). The wife of the farmer living at Skálholt during the current excavation also remembered this cellar and especially its collection of old (mostly medicine) bottles (Signý Berglind Guðmundsóttir, pers.comm, to Gavin Lucas, 30.06.2004). The house was also used as accomodation for the workmen during the construction of the cathedral but was finally torn down in 1958 when the area was also levelled.  The whole cellar was infilled with demolition material ([948], [1060]) and sealed by further demolition [850], [1057/1245] and [1236] spreading to the east and south.",Western Farmhouse,Bær (vestur),
123,S29.3,1900,1900,,"In a secondary phase to this building, the northern timber screen wall was re-built with turf/earth and stone as the passage [106] went out of use and was infilled (see Structure XIII, S13.3/4). The new northern wall [111] consisted of coarse stone facing with a turf/earth fill, the stones of which may have derived from robbing [1106] of the drain [1117] in the passage [106]. The building otherwise kept its southern timber gable, east and west walls, and its internal dimensions. The interior floor of the structure was now stone paved [098], including some very large, flat flagstones marking an external paving in front of the building. A TPQ of c.1750 was associated with this paving but the building is clearly much later. It is unclear when this phase starts but it seems possible that this structure represents a re-build after a hiatus; no structure is shown in this location on the 1836 map suggesting the former infirmary had been abandoned by then but probably still visible as a ruin. The re-build in this phase may have converted this ruin into an outhouse such as a storage shed. The date of the infilling from the abandonment of this re-built structure, suggests this new building remained in use for some time into the early 19th century. These two pieces of evidence suggest that this building dates to the second half of the 19th century. This building may even be one of the ‚sheds‘ depicted on a photograph from the end of the nineteenth century.  Infilling the room and spreading out south of the building was turf collapse/debris from the walls and roof ([052], [078], [137], [472], [485], [1116]); a TPQ of 1872 was associated with ceramics from this collapse and generally the finds date to the late nineteenth century. These sealed earlier slopewash/buried soil layers.

124,S2.1-2,1902,1952,,"This was a substantial building, cutting deep into the farm mound; it comprised a nearly square foundation cut [004], measuring 9.5m east-west and 10.6m north-south, with an extant depth between 1.7m in the north and 0.7m in the south. Its sides were lined with large stones (averaging c. 0.3-0.4m in size), and in the northeastern corner, the stones had been additionally faced with concrete and the floor also laid with concrete [003]. On the early 1950s plan of the ruins of these buildings, this corner is marked out as a separate compartment; this concreting was certainly a later modification to the barn. Attached – also probably a later addition - to the southeastern corner of the barn was a circular hay silo, 3.1-3.2m in diameter and 1.7m deep [006/755], lined on its sides and base with slightly smaller and more rounded stones and faced with concrete all over [005]. An associated access or foundation cut lay on its southern side, 2.9m long (east-west) and 2.15m wide (north-south) and 0.4-0.9m deep. The first recorded concrete silo in Iceland dates to 1912 and photographs from 1924 do not show the silo so it probably dates to the late 1920s or 1930s.  Both the barn and silo were filled with the disturbed and mixed levelling layer [001] as well as collapsed material from their sides (i.e. stone rubble and concrete), but because they were excavated with the machine, no differentiation was made between the levelling layer and rubble infill.

The whole formed a Y-shaped drainage system. The drain was stone-lined and with capstones covering the top-most of the way, although there had been some disturbance at the north end. The capstones over [650] mark a probable paving through a doorway into the barn. At some point, the drain was re-modelled and extended further north – probably when the concrete bay was added in the northeast corner, as the drain extension doglegs to the west at the northern end. The extension [181] had an iron pipe in the base along the north-south section.   The construction of the foundations of the barn (hlaða) was recorded by the archaeologist Brynjúlfur Jónsson in 1902 and it‘s superstructure is mentioned in an inventory from 1908 as being made from timber and corrugated iron.

The barn was probably built over older turf outhouses from the late 19th century; Frederick Howell‘s photograph of Skálholt from 1898 was taken before the barn was built and shows two smaller buildings on the location of where the barn and byre were later built. No trace of these structures survived unless the debris described above under structure I relates to these buildings.

The barn was probably built over older turf outhouses from the late 19th century; Frederick Howell‘s photograph of Skálholt from 1898 was taken before the barn was built and shows two smaller buildings on the location of where the barn and byre were later built. No trace of these structures survived unless the debris described above under structure I relates to these buildings. According to the previous farmer at Skálholt, the barn is said to have burnt down in 1952 (Björn Erlendsson, pers.comm. 2002). ",Haybarn,hlaða,

129,S2.2,1930,1952,,"This was a substantial building, cutting deep into the farm mound; it comprised a nearly square foundation cut [004], measuring 9.5m east-west and 10.6m north-south, with an extant depth between 1.7m in the north and 0.7m in the south. Its sides were lined with large stones (averaging c. 0.3-0.4m in size), and in the northeastern corner, the stones had been additionally faced with concrete and the floor also laid with concrete [003]. On the early 1950s plan of the ruins of these buildings, this corner is marked out as a separate compartment; this concreting was certainly a later modification to the barn. Attached – also probably a later addition - to the southeastern corner of the barn was a circular hay silo, 3.1-3.2m in diameter and 1.7m deep [006/755], lined on its sides and base with slightly smaller and more rounded stones and faced with concrete all over [005]. An associated access or foundation cut lay on its southern side, 2.9m long (east-west) and 2.15m wide (north-south) and 0.4-0.9m deep. The first recorded concrete silo in Iceland dates to 1912 and photographs from 1924 do not show the silo so it probably dates to the late 1920s or 1930s.  Both the barn and silo were filled with the disturbed and mixed levelling layer [001] as well as collapsed material from their sides (i.e. stone rubble and concrete), but because they were excavated with the machine, no differentiation was made between the levelling layer and rubble infill. Possible patches of organic floor/surface deposits remained in places ([249], [342], [578], [579], [580], [590], [681]) as well as construction debris [622].  Running along the southern and eastern sides of the barn was an L-shaped drain [1139] 6.4m east-west and 4.4m north-south, with another arm [650] 5.7m long coming off at a slight angle, which led outside the barn itself. The whole formed a Y-shaped drainage system. The drain was stone-lined and with capstones covering the top-most of the way, although there had been some disturbance at the north end. The capstones over [650] mark a probable paving through a doorway into the barn. At some point, the drain was re-modelled and extended further north – probably when the concrete bay was added in the northeast corner, as the drain extension doglegs to the west at the northern end. The extension [181] had an iron pipe in the base along the north-south section.   The construction of the foundations of the barn (hlaða) was recorded by the archaeologist Brynjúlfur Jónsson in 1902 and it‘s superstructure is mentioned in an inventory from 1908 as being made from timber and corrugated iron. The dimensions of the barn are recorded as 15 x 15 al (9.5m square) and with a hipped roof. Attached to it was a byre (fjós) and stables (hesthússkúr), both made from timber and corrugated iron, both 15 x 7 ¾ al. (c. 9.5 x 4.9m) in size and both being 10 years old, and therefore presumably built around the same time as the main dwelling house in 1898 (Structure XXXV). It is not mentioned which side of the barn each is, but based on the location of the later byre (Structure I), the byre may have been on the east side. Several photographs exist of the barn and these adjacent outhouses. Further descriptions occur in subsequent estate evaluations but the most detailed is from 1947.

131,S35.2,1958,1958,,"The main farmhouse lies in the northwest corner of the main excavation area, and what survives is solely the cellar [1098], whose south-east corner just projects within the northern limit of excavation. It was clearly built into the ruin of and replaced Structure III. The cellar was stone-lined and cut down [1251] from the present surface at a depth of 0.6m; it had a damaged, flagstone floor [1084] over a drain which skirted the edge of the room; remains of an iron pipe was found in the drain.   with a farmhouse. This division seems to go back to the late 19th century; census data indicate the split occurred sometime in the 1870s and had disappeared again by 1930. No traces of the eastern farmhouse were ever found during the excavation but based on photographs and maps from the early twentieth century, this would have been located between the stables (Structure XXXIII) and the western farmhouse (Structure XXXV). Photographs from 1898 to 1924 show two gabled buildings which appear to be the eastern farm. The 1916-18 estate evaluation describes it as a timber house with iron cladding consisting of a living room (baðstofa) and shed alongside and a storage house next to it. The building was pulled down in the late 1920s as it does not recur in later estate evaluations. The western farmhouse was the main farm in use in the early 19th century (Structures III-VII) and was only levelled and re-built at the end of the 19th century when a new timber structure was erected. This is structire XXXV.  This house was built in 1897/8 and an inventory from 1908 records it as free-standing timber house, c.8 x 6.3 m, clad all over in corrugated iron and with a basement under the whole house which was, cemented. The house also had a brick chimney and a hipped roof. There was a cooker on the main floor which was quartered into four rooms, with three rooms in the loft. It is described as 10 years old. A photograph by the English traveller Frederick Howell dated to 1898, shows the house presumably being built in the background to the far left. Later estate evaluations describe the same building; in 1916-18 it is described as 8.16 x 6.3m with one floor but with a loft space, presumably under the hipped roof. A photograph taken between 1902 and 1905 shows the house in a better view. The house is depicted again in photographs taken by the state antiquarian Matthías Þórðarson in 1924, only now the roof has clearly been re-built into the more common pitched type. An estate evaluation from 1938 also now describes a two-storied house with a loft space and a stone cellar; the whole building is 8 x 10m and the ground floor has four rooms and a kitchen, the upper floor four bedrooms. There is a cooker, coal oven and water pipes. The house has clearly increased in size by this point and this seems to relate to an extension on the eastern side, increasing the length from 6.3 to 10m. The extension is shown on the photograph from 1902-5, suggesting it happened before the roof re-modelling. In a 1947 evaluation the house is described in two parts, the main part and the extension. The main part is only classed as one storey, 8 x6.1m with a loft and stone basement; the basement is described as little used. The main floor has a living room, two bedrooms and a kitchen, while in the loft there is a living area and two bedrooms. The extension is 4.5 x3.5m, and consisted of a living room on the main floor and two bedrooms in the in loft.  According to the 1947 evaluation, on both the west and east sides of the farmhouse were two sets of farm buildings, including both a byre and a haybarn. Those to the east were excavated (Structures I, II and XXXIII) while those to the west lay outside the excavation area. The western byre was only built in 1942 and was 9.8 x 6.4m, while the western haybarn was 9.8x9.5m and dug down by 1m. Both were timber framed, iron clad and with an asbestos roof. These western farm buildings can  be seen on photographs taken during the 1950s excavations at Skálholt.  A local from the area Guðmundur Indriðason vaguely remembered the timber farmhouse and the basement which was described as small and not used very often; it had a trapdoor and ladder to the main floor (pers.comm. to Elín Hreiðarsdóttir, 15.07.2004). The wife of the farmer living at Skálholt during the current excavation also remembered this cellar and especially its collection of old (mostly medicine) bottles (Signý Berglind Guðmundsóttir, pers.comm, to Gavin Lucas, 30.06.2004). The house was also used as accomodation for the workmen during the construction of the cathedral but was finally torn down in 1958 when the area was also levelled.  The whole cellar was infilled with demolition material ([948], [1060]) and sealed by further demolition [850], [1057/1245] and [1236] spreading to the east and south.",Western Farmhouse,Bær (vestur),
